He is hunted by the police for a series of murders he knows nothing about, a woman who claims to be his wife is after him, and so is a mysterious &quot;doctor&quot;. But his worst trouble is the strangers, a series of vastly powerful beings who seem to manipulate just about everything in the city, and want him because of the extraordinary powers he manifested. John decides to find out what is happening in his city; why is it always night? And why can nobody tell him a way to leave the city?\n\nSimilar in some ways to Matrix or Existenz.\n\nIMDB 7.6 out of 10 stars.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00c39b76dacc5838af5259932c4486250849d0be","amp;dn":"Dark+City","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00c39b76dacc5838af5259932c4486250849d0be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,195,155,118,218,204,88,56,175,82,89,147,44,68,134,37,8,73,208,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
