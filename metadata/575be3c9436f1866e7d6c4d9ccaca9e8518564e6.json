Things go awry while he&amp;#039;s stealing a huge diamond in downtown L.A.: a thief, Deacon, tries a double-cross, the police arrive, and Miles is arrested, but not before he hides the jewel in an air duct of a building under construction. Two years&amp;#039; later, he&amp;#039;s out of prison and he heads for the site: it&amp;#039;s L.A.&amp;#039;s new police headquarters! Posing as a reassigned cop, Miles gets into the building, but before he can recover the swag, he&amp;#039;s partnered with a naive detective and sent out to investigate burglaries. With Deacon on his trail, he must recover the diamond, keep the cops fooled, and do a few good deeds as a detective who can think like a criminal.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:575be3c9436f1866e7d6c4d9ccaca9e8518564e6","amp;dn":"Blue+Streak.DVDRip.XviD-PePPage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"575be3c9436f1866e7d6c4d9ccaca9e8518564e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,91,227,201,67,111,24,102,231,214,196,217,204,172,169,232,81,133,100,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
