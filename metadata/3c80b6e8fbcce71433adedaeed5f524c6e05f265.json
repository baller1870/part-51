I don\\&amp;#039;t want anyone to do\npiracy here! This software is a good way to protect your investment, because I have\nnotice that this type of media seems very fragile, if it\\&amp;#039;s scratched a little or \ndirty, it won\\&amp;#039;t play. It seems less tolerent than DVD format. (Higher density!)\n\n\n-What \\&quot;Backup HDDVD\\&quot; is doing exactly?\n\nThis is a java based command line utility that decrypt video files (.evo) from a\nHD DVD disk that you own, to your hard drive and you can play them back with a\nHD DVD player software.\n\n\n-What are the system requirements to use \\&quot;Backup HDDVD\\&quot;\n\n1 - A Windows based system\n2 - A HDDVD disk drive\n3 - A HDDVD player software (like PowerDVD)\n4 - A HDDVD movie(s)\n5 - Java rutime 1.5\n6 - The possibility to access the content of the disk with a drive letter under windows.\n(you may need UDF 2.5 file system driver for this)\n7 - A lot of free hard disk space to backup your movies!\n\n\n***********************************************\nTHE UPLOADER HAVE NOT TESTED THIS PROGRAM SO PLEASE DON\\&amp;#039;T ASK HOW TO\\&amp;#039;s\n***********************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c80b6e8fbcce71433adedaeed5f524c6e05f265","amp;dn":"BackupHDDVD.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c80b6e8fbcce71433adedaeed5f524c6e05f265","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,128,182,232,251,204,231,20,51,173,237,174,237,95,82,76,110,5,242,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
