It&amp;#039;s called &amp;#039;Eruption&amp;#039; and      \nit&amp;#039;s going to blow a hole sky high in the Trance        \nmusic fraternity!                                      \nDual Core is comprised of two nuclear fission            \nreactors who go by the name of Adi Milner and Eran          \nBen Gaon. Both artists have had successful solo          \ncareers, recording and performing around the world as    \nBackspace (that&amp;#039;s Adi) and Point that&amp;#039;s Eran.            \nAs the saying goes&amp;#039;two heads are better than one&amp;#039; and    \nso to record this album they decided to pool their    \ntalents and become &amp;#039;as One&amp;#039;...a Dual Coretwice as        \npotent!                                                  \nWhat we can say with certainty is that these two        \nfellows share the common aim to stimulate the senses,    \nto enliven the mind, and to free up the body with        \nmusic that is fiery, hot and explosive on the              \ndance-floor.                                            \nSo remember while it is true to say that some            \nvolcanoes lie dormant or quietly smoulder for years,      \nif, and when they do erupt, you better be ready to          \nrun for cover!                                          \nWe would like to take the\nopportunity to point out that psytrance\nneeds YOUR SUPPORT. We only want to\ngive you a preview in psytrance,\nambient and electronic music and\nin our opinion this is absolutely\nNO alternative to buying.\nMP3 isnt the same as holding a\nbought record in your hands !!\nYou need to feel the bass to go with the\nflow ... and that&amp;#039;s what mp3 just can&amp;#039;t\ngive you.
