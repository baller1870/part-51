Five-time champion Arnold Schwarzenegger defends his Mr. Olympia title against Serge Nubret and the shy young deaf Lou Ferrigno, whose father is his coach; the ruthless champ psyches out the young lion. Sardinian Franco Columbu competes in the lightweight class; at home in Italy he solves a tight parking problem by lifting the car into place. Joe Weider is the marketer; Mike Katz and Ken Waller go for the title of Mr. Universe. Bodybuilding and a celebrity-to-be go mainstream.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:175ae8133ea5ad3d00fbf1b18ab41e2c663d6c93","amp;dn":"Pumping.Iron.25th.Special.Edition%5B2003%5DDVDrip%5BEnglish%5D%3E10_CP_33%3C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"175ae8133ea5ad3d00fbf1b18ab41e2c663d6c93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,90,232,19,62,165,173,61,0,251,241,177,138,180,30,44,102,61,108,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
