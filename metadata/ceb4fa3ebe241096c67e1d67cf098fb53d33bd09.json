Filmed on the last two nights of the Boosh\\&amp;#039;s 2006 tour in Brixton Academy (London).\n\nUnfortunately, DVD was released without subtitles. There are no extras, cause they\\&amp;#039;re on the second DVD (actually there are only extras on the second disc). If you\\&amp;#039;ll want, I can upload it too, just let me know via comment. \n\nBoosh is always worth to watch it. So enjoy it!\n\nRead about Mighty Boosh here: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416394/\n\nCast: Julian Barratt (as Howard Moon), Noel Fielding (as Vince Noir), Michael Fielding (as Naboo), Rich Fulcher (as Bob Fossil), Dave Brown (as Bollo)\n\nGenre................: Comedy.\nCountry..............: UK\nReleased.............: November 13th 2006.\nFormat...............: DVD-R (REGION FREE!).\nSize.................: 4.46 GB DVD.\nLanguage.............: English.\nSubtitles............: None\nScreen Size..........: 4:3 &amp; 16:9","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ceb4fa3ebe241096c67e1d67cf098fb53d33bd09","amp;dn":"The+Mighty+Boosh+Live+DVD+-+Disc+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ceb4fa3ebe241096c67e1d67cf098fb53d33bd09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,180,250,62,190,36,16,150,198,126,29,103,207,9,143,181,61,51,189,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
