As stated above, Audio is strictly English, and I believe there are subtitles in each language. \n\nIm Glad to see so many people taking a chance on a release with so few seeders off the start. It just goes to show people are willing to wait for quality.\n\nAgain I put the image (actual picture) of the DVD in JPG and PNG formats, (PNG is bigger but handles transparency so well). If u need the cover of the case its in the first torrent, found here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3693597/PANS_LABYRINTH&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3693597/PANS_LABYRINTH&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--007Ace--\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ad9b62596b2aa4e1023497e4f79ca66aa2641d1","amp;dn":"PANS+LABYRINTH+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ad9b62596b2aa4e1023497e4f79ca66aa2641d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,217,182,37,150,178,170,78,16,35,73,126,79,121,202,102,170,38,65,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
