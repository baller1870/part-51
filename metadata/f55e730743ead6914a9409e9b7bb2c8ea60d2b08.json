Togusa is now the new leader of the team, that has considerably increased its appointed personnel. The expanded new Section 9 confronts a rash of complicated incidents, and investigations reveal that an ultra-wizard hacker named the Puppeteer is behind the entire series of events.\n\nIn the midst of all, Batou, who was stalking the case on a separate track, encounters Motoko. She goes away after saying, &quot;Stay away from the Solid State Society.&quot; Batou is left with a doubt in his mind. Could Motoko be the the Puppeteer?\n\nThe series of intriguing incidents that Section 9 faces gradually link together almost artistically. Who is the Puppeteer? What will happen to Batou`s relationship with Motoko? What is the full truth behind this carefully planned perfect crime? And what will the outcome be? Mysteries surround the Solid State Society...\n\nNOTE: The word &quot;Puppeteer&quot; is used in this text as a temporary translation for the original Japanese term &quot;Kugutsu Mawashi,&quot; and it is not meant to be the official English adaptation.\n\n[Taken from Production I.G`s GitS: SAC SSS page at http://www.productionig.com/contents/works_sp/47_/index.html]\n\n\nFor more info: http://anidb.net/a4414/\n\nFor playback problems: http://cccp-project.net/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f55e730743ead6914a9409e9b7bb2c8ea60d2b08","amp;dn":"%5Bniizk%5D+Ghost+in+the+Shell+-+Solid+State+Society+%28h264%2C+DVD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f55e730743ead6914a9409e9b7bb2c8ea60d2b08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,94,115,7,67,234,214,145,74,148,9,233,183,187,44,142,166,13,43,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
