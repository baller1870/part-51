Vernon ÃƒÂ¢??JakeÃƒÂ¢?? Porter. The music that came out on his Combo label is almost always representative of its surroundings, and of that populationÃƒÂ¢??s taste. Within the walls of his home studio Jake Porter oversaw the production of a lot of fantastic music and, as the owners of his catalogue, Ace is committed to bringing you the best of it, via compilations such as this monthÃƒÂ¢??s COOL DADDY.\n\ncast of characters, as the majority of them have already appeared on either ÃƒÂ¢??Straight To WattsÃƒÂ¢?? or ÃƒÂ¢??Central RocksÃƒÂ¢??. New ÃƒÂ¢??recruitsÃƒÂ¢?? this time around include a very young sounding Bill Watkins and a not-so-young sounding Joe Morris ÃƒÂ¢?? who, both annotator Jim Dawson and I suspect to be the same Joe Morris whose orchestra hit big with Anytime, Any Place, Anywhere as the 40s drew to a close. We also feature one side that transplanted Texas bluesman Peppermint Harris cut for Combo, during the briefest of stays in JakeÃƒÂ¢??s musical stock company. And, by way of complete contrast, we also feature an early example of ÃƒÂ¢??rapÃƒÂ¢??, via one side of an extremely rare 45 rpm recitation by DJ Hunter HancockÃƒÂ¢??s radio sidekick Margie Williams. As Jim Dawon note points out, this never stood a chance of becoming a hit as ÃƒÂ¢??OlÃƒÂ¢?? HHÃƒÂ¢?? was the only DJ who was likely to play it.\n\nAs well as being heard as the guitarist on many of these sessions, itÃƒÂ¢??s always great to be able to bring you Gene Phillips in his own right, and here is the previously unheard SteelinÃƒÂ¢?? The Blues. We never need any excuse to reissue the groovy saxophony of Jack McVea, either. He and his band can be heard backing a variety of vocalists throughout ÃƒÂ¢??Cool DaddyÃƒÂ¢??, ranging from big blues-shouters like the veteran piano ponder Christine Chatman and McVeaÃƒÂ¢??s own missus, Louise Beatty, to impassioned wailers such as the terminally obscure Rudy Pitts. We also get the chance to hear him out-Bostic Earl, on a fruity blast through the standard Oh How I Miss You Tonight.\n\nWe feature a couple of sides that shine a spotlight on Jake Porter himself and hear from JakeÃƒÂ¢??s other bandleader mainstays Floyd Turnham and Chuck Higgins ÃƒÂ¢?? who is the subject of his own Combo anthology next month. ThereÃƒÂ¢??s also an instrumental from JakeÃƒÂ¢??s other sax king, Joe Houston, with a never-before-heard alternate of his great grinder ShuckinÃƒÂ¢??.\n\nNellie LutcherÃƒÂ¢??s chum Betty Hall Jones gives a neat female spin on Louis JordanÃƒÂ¢??s Outskirts Of Town saga, while weÃƒÂ¢??re also happy to put the flip of Honey ColemanÃƒÂ¢??s sole Combo record back into catalogue after a short gap of 55 years. Also pretty cool is Candy Rivers and her occasional singing chum (and ace session guitarist) Chuck HamiltonÃƒÂ¢??s jazzy spin on the standard Please Be Kind, which is getting its first airing anywhere.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35d5373e69cb4bbb06f0b0369202791971b2cbb4","amp;dn":"Cool+Daddy-+The+Central+Avenue+Scene+1951-1957%2C+Vol.+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35d5373e69cb4bbb06f0b0369202791971b2cbb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,213,55,62,105,203,75,187,6,240,176,54,146,2,121,25,113,178,203,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
