Cellist Ben Davis and his quintet Basquiat Strings have taken their time before releasing their first album, but it&amp;#039;s worth the wait. Because these classically trained string players have grown up alongside non-classical musicians, their use of jazz compositional methods, rhythms and improvisation is not at all forced: they rock.\n\nDavis&amp;#039;s fine tunes include the spiky Double Dares and the intense Junk. These are augmented by standards: Infant Eyes (Shorter), In A Silent Way (Zawinul) and a brilliant interpretation of Ornette Coleman&amp;#039;s Lonely Woman.Drummer Seb Rochford adds effective, self-effacing drum parts, and the quintet lineup means that Rochford and bassist Richard Pryce can work as a rhythm team behind the others when needed. Basquiat feels like a real, gigging band, with great solos from all players, and Davis is a star.\n\nIn short, for the discering music listener who can enjoy in equal parts, but nit necessarily with the same ear, contemporary classical and jazz.\n\nLove music.  Enjoy life.
