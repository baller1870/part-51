Same sort of topics etc. But I always end up feeling as if I have received more information from Kevin&amp;#039;s 2-hour show, than what I&amp;#039;m getting from Coast&amp;#039;s 4-hour show.\n\nIf you like Coast To Coast AM, chances are that you will like this show, as well.\n\nLearn more @ www.kevinsmithshow.com\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07c02c532497f2a16197b84f513f23a9caff3495","amp;dn":"Kevin+Smith+Show+%5B09.17.07%5D+Astronaut+Brian+o%5C%27Leary.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07c02c532497f2a16197b84f513f23a9caff3495","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,192,44,83,36,151,242,161,97,151,184,79,81,63,35,169,202,255,52,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
