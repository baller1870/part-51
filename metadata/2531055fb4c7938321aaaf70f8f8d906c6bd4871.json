Thompson\\&amp;#039;s novel of the same name. The film details a whacky search for the \\&quot;American Dream\\&quot;, by Thompson and his crazed, Samoan lawyer. Fueled by the massive amount of drugs they purchased with an advance from a magazine to cover a sporting event in Vegas; they set out in the Red Shark. Encountering police, reporters, gamblers, racers, and hitchhikers; they search for some undefinable thing know only as the \\&quot;American Dream\\&quot; and find fear, loathing and hilarious adventures into the dementia of the modern American West.\n\nSource: NTSC DVD\nRes:  720x320\nCodec: Xvid\nAudio: mp3 196kbps AC3\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2531055fb4c7938321aaaf70f8f8d906c6bd4871","amp;dn":"Fear+and+Loathing+in+Las+Vegas+%281998%29+DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2531055fb4c7938321aaaf70f8f8d906c6bd4871","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,49,5,95,180,199,147,131,33,170,175,112,248,248,217,6,198,189,72,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
