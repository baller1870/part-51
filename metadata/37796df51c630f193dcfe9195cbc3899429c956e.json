Paula Crisostomo (now Romo) is not Mexican- American--she is Filipina-American. She and her husband, then boyfriend were roommates of mine in college. We are very good friends and I see her often.  Written by Norma Schaffer\n\nWalkout is the true story of a young Mexican American high school teacher, Sal Castro. He mentors a group of students in East Los Angeles, when the students decide to stage a peaceful walkout to protest the injustices of the public school system. Set against the background of the civil rights movement of 1968, it is a story of courage and the fight for justice and empowerment.
