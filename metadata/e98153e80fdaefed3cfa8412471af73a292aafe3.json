Come on, Knightmare was never really a visually intensive programme was it? :)\n\n-----\n\nKnightmare was a fantasy adventure game show, shown on Children\\&amp;#039;s ITV in the UK between 1987 and 1994. It was created and produced by Tim Child and was a Broadsword Television production for Anglia Television/ITV. The show made extensive use of the \\&amp;#039;Cromakey\\&amp;#039; (blue screen) technique to generate rooms and scenes with different backgrounds and graphics.\n\nThe adventure was set mostly in a dungeon, and there were three \\&amp;#039;levels\\&amp;#039; corresponding to difficulty. Teams of four took it in turns to challenge the dungeon to complete a \\&amp;#039;quest\\&amp;#039; - usually to retrieve a symbolic object, such as a Crown or Shield. The dungeon master \\&amp;#039;Treguard\\&amp;#039;, and his assistant occasionally helped teams along their way as they solved problems, puzzles and riddles\n\nThe \\&amp;#039;dungeoneer\\&amp;#039; is the one person of the team who is guided through the adventure, and wears a helmet to blind them from reality. He or She is guided by the three other members of the team, known as their \\&amp;#039;advisors\\&amp;#039;, who sit in the dungeon ante-chamber and watch the adventure through a \\&amp;#039;Magic Mirror\\&amp;#039;.\n\nThe object of each quest was decided at the start, and teams would be awarded with a medal or FrightKnight trophy upon successful completion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e98153e80fdaefed3cfa8412471af73a292aafe3","amp;dn":"Knightmare+Season+2+%28HI-QUAL%29+%5BSR-Enc%5D%5Bbombus%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e98153e80fdaefed3cfa8412471af73a292aafe3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,129,83,232,15,218,239,237,60,250,132,18,71,26,247,58,41,42,175,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
