About .:\n\nThe -Utopia-City- game will amaze your imagination and let\nyou feel that everything going on is absolutely real.\n \nDon&amp;#039;t miss it!!!\n\nThe game is set in the virtual city, Utopia. This is a fictional place,\nbut much of the information you explore is almost real and amazes\nby its originality. Utopia-City is inhabited by human beings, for whom\nthis virtual world has become a drug, they cannot give up. \n\nThey even do not understand that there is no way back for them. Humans\nlive in a virtual paradise and do not surmise the danger represented by this\nunreal world to all of them. By the way, there are also security guards and \ndestructors in Utopia-City. \n\nTheir task is to defend UtopiaCity from external intrusion and support life in it.\nUtopia seems to be an animate organism. At first it is quite loyal to a player\nhowever, if he shows aggression Utopia does its best to try to defend its world.\n\nA player gets into the City in order to rescue mankind captured by a Mastermind \nand lost in a digital world. \n\nThe problem is that the Utopia-City inhabitants do not want to leave \nUtopia and soever try to hinder their own rescue.\n\n\n\n\n.: install :.\n\n1.: Unrar and double click on _Install.bat\n\n2.: Launch game with bin/utopiaLauncher.exe\n\n3.: enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n.: note :.\n\nget em or miss em &gt;&gt;&gt; forever!\n\n\na Toed Production 2oo7\n\n\n\n( must have ) - ( rare ) - ( must have ) - ( rare ) - ( must have ) - ( rare )\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edc675f21c09ce17c53a5cd2f83efd4a066639db","amp;dn":"PC_Utopia+City+%28rip%2Bfix%29-%28ToeD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edc675f21c09ce17c53a5cd2f83efd4a066639db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,198,117,242,28,9,206,23,197,58,92,210,248,62,253,74,6,102,57,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
