Varje cd ligger seperat sÃƒÂ¥ ni kan vÃƒÂ¤lja vilka ni vill ha genom att kryssa alla eller enbart nÃƒÂ¥got album sÃƒÂ¥\nhÃƒÂ¥ll tillgodo och seeda pÃƒÂ¥  :) \n\n (ps inte bÃƒÂ¤sta linan sÃƒÂ¥ inget gnÃƒÂ¤ll om hastighet tack.ds)\n\nFacts of the group:\n\nRunrig is a six-piece band, originating mostly from the Western Isles of Scotland. It performs a mixture of Gaelic and English-spoken songs, almost all of which is written by the band. The music is not as well known south-of-the-border as it might be, though in Scotland and in parts of continental Europe the band has a large and dedicated following. \n\nThe lead singer with the band, Bruce Guthro, is the only non-Scottish member, originating from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, Canada. After 19 years with the band, the previous lead singer Donnie Munro left to pursue other interest in the fields of arts and politics. Donnie left the band after a set of concerts which culminated in a major farewell event at Stirling Castle on 28th, 29th and 30th August. Needless to say the nights were all sell-outs, and the atmosphere on the final night was absolutely electric, and very emotional for all. Donnie will be sadly missed from the line-up, but the band will continue, and the new singer, Bruce, will ensure its success for the next twenty years.... \n\n\nBand members are:\nBruce Guthro -- Vocals \nRory MacDonald -- Bass, Vocals/Harmonies, Accordion \nMalcolm Jones -- Guitars, Mandolin, Accordion, Midi Bagpipes, Acoustic Bass \nPeter Wishart -- Keyboards \nIan Bayne -- Drums/Percussion \nCalum MacDonald -- Percussion, Vocals \nFormer leadsinger Donnie Munro left the band in August of 1997 to pursue a career in politics, and the new lead singer is a Canadian singer and songwriter Bruce Guthro. Donnie Murno has now started a solo career in addition to pursuing politics, and has his own website\n\nMore facts here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runrig&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runrig&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.runrig.co.uk/home.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.runrig.co.uk/home.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n   _Supplied by LWan _\n   ___________________\n   _________________________________\n   _Saker som lagts ut? \n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/LWan/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/LWan/&lt;/a&gt;\n   _________________________________\n   Tack till alla som seedar vidare ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa1762ee44e0f03648dfbc90f34269d639dd300e","amp;dn":"RunrigCd%5C%27s-LWan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa1762ee44e0f03648dfbc90f34269d639dd300e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,23,98,238,68,224,240,54,72,223,188,144,243,66,105,214,57,221,48,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
