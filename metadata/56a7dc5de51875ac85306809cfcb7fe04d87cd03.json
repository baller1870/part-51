You assume the role of Alice Sanger, female private eye. She is assigned to get a briefcase, but quickly finds herself immersed in a web of corruption and shadowy motives. What follows is a mysterious journey through the layers of a future metropolis with 50s noir influences.\n\nRevival :Fate by Numbers was made as a graduation project for Communication and Multimedia Design (CMD, Avans) in Breda, the Netherlands. Revival is the name of the fictional company behind the game, set up by four students. The game was made on a shoestring budget (1500,- euro). Purpose of the game was to make a FMV-game to satisfy old school adventure gamers and introduce new players to the genre. But also to see if  it is possible to make this kind of game using pro-consumer  technology, previously only available for big budget (game) companies.\n\nThis is the vista compatible version (a patch is available on the official website)\n\nwww.fatebynumbers.com\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56a7dc5de51875ac85306809cfcb7fe04d87cd03","amp;dn":"Fate+by+Numbers+-+episode+1+-+1.1.0+-+1%2C2+gb+version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56a7dc5de51875ac85306809cfcb7fe04d87cd03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,167,220,93,229,24,117,172,133,48,104,9,207,203,127,224,77,135,205,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
