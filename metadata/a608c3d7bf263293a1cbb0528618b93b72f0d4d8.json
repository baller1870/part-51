From the 2007 New Yorker Festival.\n\n\nNew Yorker editor David Remnick interviewed the intense and dogged Seymour Hersh this past weekend during the New Yorker festival, who elaborated on his recent reporting regarding the Bush administration&amp;#039;s plans for Iran (hint: going strong!) as well as on his thoughts on the Iraq war, America&amp;#039;s place in the world, fact-checking recalcitrant sources, and the upcoming presidential election (to say he&amp;#039;s looking forward to it is putting it mildly). Hersh told Remnick early on that &quot;It doesn&amp;#039;t matter what I think, it matters what I know and what I can learn,&quot; but Remnick managed to coax a few opinions out of him ÃƒÂ¢?? not that it takes much coaxing to get him to talk. Our fingers were flying across our laptops to try and capture it all (we noted after that it was like the opposite of watching a presidential debate, in that so much was actually said), standby for his continued commentary on his sources, the U.S. and torture, the work of other journalists, and the stuff he doesn&amp;#039;t write about. And blogs, because everyone&amp;#039;s got an opinion about blogs.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a608c3d7bf263293a1cbb0528618b93b72f0d4d8","amp;dn":"A+Conversation+With+Seymour+Hersh+-+2007+-+Xvid+.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a608c3d7bf263293a1cbb0528618b93b72f0d4d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,8,195,215,191,38,50,147,161,203,176,82,134,24,185,59,114,240,212,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
