Born in Vienna, he studied at the conservatory there, moving to the United States in 1958 when he received a scholarship to the Berklee School of Music in Boston. He worked in the &amp;#039;60s with a variety of the era&amp;#039;s jazz luminaries (Maynard Ferguson, Dinah Washington, Cannonball Adderley) before encountering Miles Davis. The trumpet player&amp;#039;s In a Silent Way was named for Zawinul&amp;#039;s title track. This led to the formation of Weather Report, the band he co-led with Wayne Shorter for 15 years.\n\nFaces &amp; Places mixes vocalists and instrumentalists with daring grace. &quot;Rooftops of Vienna&quot; is a wistful ode that&amp;#039;s tinged with the sweetly sad backward glances of a man growing older and finding his boyhood home darting through his dreams. It uses singers as part of the musical stew, rather than as a narrative component. With its blend of exotic acoustic instruments and contemporary electronics, this set is very much in keeping with the direction of Weather Report from the time of Black Market and beyond. \n\n01 - The Search.\t\n02 - All About Simon.\t\n03 - Introduction To Tower Of Silence.\t\n04 - Tower Of Silence.\t\n05 - The Spirit Of Julian C Adderley.\t\n06 - Familiar To Me.\t\n07 - Cafe Andalusia.\t\n08 - Good Day.\t\n09 - Barefoot Beauty.\t\n10 - Rooftops Of Vienna.\t\n11 - Borges Buenos Aires Part 1.\t\n12 - Borges Buenos Aires Part 2.\t\n13 - Siseya.\t\n14 - East 12Th Street Band.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe3e3cb422863ea4c15e321fc7e16f6269c8ee9a","amp;dn":"joe+zawinul+-+2002+-+faces+%26+places+%28Jazz+mp3+%40+320%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe3e3cb422863ea4c15e321fc7e16f6269c8ee9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,62,60,180,34,134,62,164,193,94,50,31,199,225,111,98,105,200,238,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
