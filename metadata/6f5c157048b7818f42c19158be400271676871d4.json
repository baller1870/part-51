Geils Band finally broke through into the big leagues with Freeze Frame. Fans of the hard-driving rock of the group&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;70s albums will find the sleek sound of Freeze Frame slightly disorienting, but the production gives the album cohesion. Good-time rock &amp; roll remains at the core of the group&amp;#039;s music, but the sound of the record is glossier, shining with synthesizers and big pop hooks. With its singalong chorus, &quot;Centerfold&quot; exemplifies this trend, but it&amp;#039;s merely the tip of the iceberg. &quot;Freeze Frame&quot; has a great stop-start chorus, &quot;Flamethrower&quot; and &quot;Piss on the Wall&quot; rush along on hard-boogie riffs, and &quot;Angel in Blue&quot; is terrific neo-doo wop. There are still a handful of throwaways, but even the filler has a stylized, synthesized flair that makes it enjoyable, and the keepers are among the band&amp;#039;s best. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide \n \n\n freeze frame - album credits \n Steve Marcantonio \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f5c157048b7818f42c19158be400271676871d4","amp;dn":"J+Geils+Band+-+Freeze+Frame++vbr+200+-+250+Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f5c157048b7818f42c19158be400271676871d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,92,21,112,72,183,129,143,66,193,145,88,190,64,2,113,103,104,113,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
