Rockbox offers an alternative to the host device&amp;#039;s operating system firmware (in many cases without removing the original firmware) which provides a plug-in architecture for adding various enhancements and functionality to DAPs which are not present in the original OS. Enhancements include PDA functionality, applications, utilities, and games. Rockbox can also retrofit video playback functionality onto DAPs first released in mid-2000\n\n    * Gapless playback\n    * Replay Gain[2]\n    * 5 band fully parametric equalizer[2]\n    * OTF (&quot;on the fly&quot;) playlists\n    * True random shuffle (fresh randomly shuffled list every time)\n    * Custom UI themes\n    * Stereo recording to WAV/AIFF/WavPack (lossless) and MP3[3] (supporting devices)\n    * FM radio, including FM recording (supporting devices)\n    * Remote control (supporting devices)\n    * Digital SPDIF input/output (supporting devices)\n    * Last.fm support (even on players lacking RTC)\n    * Cue sheet support\n    * Changeable selector bar\n    * Album art [4]\n\n[edit] Plug-ins\n\nDevelopers of Rockbox are able to create new plug-ins, which provide the user with other enhancements that may not be available on various firmware modules.\n\nAt the current development stage, the following plug-ins are available.\n\n    * JPEG viewer (16 bit color/33 shade greyscale) [5]\n    * Rockboy Game Boy emulator (port of Gnuboy) [6]\n    * ZXBox ZX Spectrum emulator (port of Spectemu) [7]\n    * Doom (port of the PrBoom engine)\n    * WAV to MP3 encoder\n    * WAV to WavPack encoder\n    * MPEG video player [1]\n    * Various games including sudoku, solitaire, minesweeper, pong and many others (see http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/PluginIndex for an official list of plugins)\n    * MIDI player, realtime on some targets.
