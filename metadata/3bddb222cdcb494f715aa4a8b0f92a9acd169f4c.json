Apart from gaming, it simulates personality types, social structures and a whole range of group dynamics.\n\nIn 2005, courtesy of its creators at Blizzard Entertainment, the ancient Blood God &quot;Hakkar the Soulflayer&quot; unleashed a devastating plague, &quot;corrupted blood&quot;, upon a totally unprepared population of avatars. Unintentionally, the digital &quot;black death&quot; spread to cities and depopulated whole areas. The epidemic could only be controlled by shutting down and restarting the game world, a measure unfortunately not available in the &quot;real&quot; world. However, other measures such as quarantine or improved treatment are available in the real world and can be simulated by disease modelling. Disease modelling is essentially a virtualisation of reality that tries to gain insights into hitherto unknown inderdependencies and to simulate intervention scenarios.\n\nI will give a brief overview of the use of infectious disease modelling in a population and explain the disease dynamics of the &quot;corrupted blood&quot; epidemic in WoW. I will focus on cross references to the &quot;real world&quot; and illustrate why Blizzard, in effect, had created sexually transmitted measles for online denizens.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bddb222cdcb494f715aa4a8b0f92a9acd169f4c","amp;dn":"24c3-2322-en-infectious_diseases.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bddb222cdcb494f715aa4a8b0f92a9acd169f4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,221,178,34,205,203,73,79,113,90,164,168,176,249,42,154,205,22,159,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
