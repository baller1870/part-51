However, it focuses primarily on the U.S.\n\nIt has three main parts.\n\nPart I - Religion\nPart II - 9/11\nPart III - Federal Reserve/Central Banking\n\nThis is available to stream off google video:\n\nThe sources and contact info are here:\n\nI created a simple DVD5 ISO, for those who wanted to burn and share. However, its origin lies in a download from google video. I tried to enhance it, and ran it through CCE 2.7(3 pass) when I encoded it. So, until the creator releases the source file for download, this is probably the best quality you can get.\n\nTake everything with a grain of salt.\nSeek the truth.\nDiscover what the true zeitgeist is...\n\nNote: Wikipedia DOES NOT have the answers to everything, you might have to open books people. =)\n\nRegards,\nZWarren69","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2493ae7a88bc43853897ca76880eeea2c87026ec","amp;dn":"Zeitgeist+the+movie%2C+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2493ae7a88bc43853897ca76880eeea2c87026ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,147,174,122,136,188,67,133,56,151,202,118,136,14,238,162,200,112,38,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
