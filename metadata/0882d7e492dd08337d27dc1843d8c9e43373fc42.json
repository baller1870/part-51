Since the 1960&amp;#039;s, Charles Taylor has written, in books such \nas &quot;The Malaise of Modernity&quot;, about the earthshaking transformations in \nculture and spirituality that define our modern era. In recent years he has \nbeen increasingly concerned with escalating bigotry and the violence it \nproduces. Taylor is also known as a political activist and theorist as well as \na Roman Catholic thinker. He has just been awarded the $1.5 million Templeton \nPrize to promote research into how spiritual aspirations shape society and \npolitics.We met at the University of McGill in Montreal, where at 76, Taylor \nstill lectures and is Professor Emeritus.\n\nCharles Taylor argues the need for citizens everywhere to engage fully in \npolitics. Our second subject exemplifies such commitment, regardless of cost. \nIn Russia today, one of the big questions is how much oxygen remains in its \ndemocracy.  Former Grand Chess Master Garry Kasparov, one of the greatest \nplayers ever, has decided that preserving freedom is a contest he has to be \ninvolved in and he&amp;#039;s prepared to risk his own liberty to do so. Kasparov is \nlooking ahead to the much anticipated Presidential elections in Russia in 2008. \nVladimir Putin is scheduled to step down, because the Constitution prevents him \nfrom seeking a third term. That opens the race to the liberal opposition. \nKasparov could run in those elections. He&amp;#039;s now  part of a broad coalition of \nopposition parties called THE OTHER RUSSIA. The liberal oppsition in Russia \nused to be a lively part of the political scene. But under Putin it has been \nsidelined. That is now changing. This spring there have been anti Kremlin \nprotests, the like of which hasn&amp;#039;t been seen in years. The CBC&amp;#039;s Moscow \nreporter Nick Spicer is tracking the liberal oppostion&amp;#039;s tentative steps \nforward with Kasparov as its most charismatic leader.\n\n\n--\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0882d7e492dd08337d27dc1843d8c9e43373fc42","amp;dn":"Spirituality+and+Politics+-+CBC+-+Our+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0882d7e492dd08337d27dc1843d8c9e43373fc42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,130,215,228,146,221,8,51,125,39,220,24,67,216,201,228,51,115,252,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
