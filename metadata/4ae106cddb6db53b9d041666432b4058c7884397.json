BlowUp makes advanced image scaling easy, preserves smooth, crisp edges and lines, and creates four times (1600% area) enlargements from any image without jagged artifacts or halos. In some cases, BlowUp can enlarge up to six times (3600% area) without obvious artifacts.\n\nBlowUp includes advanced features such as photo grain controls, enlargement-specific sharpening, and support for most image modes, including CMYK. BlowUp also supports 16- and 32-bit images and is optimized for multi-core and multi-processor systems. These features make BlowUp perfect for a professional photographer creating gallery prints from digital photos, as well as an amateur photographer creating a poster from a favorite snapshot. Graphic designers can now easily scale Web graphics up to print resolution or rescale everyday images for large format printing and outdoor advertising.
