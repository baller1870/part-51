Powerful testimony from credible people. Program never aired to my knowledge (wonder why?), I simply intercepted it by means I wish to not disclose. I have had it for about ten years, since which time only my friends and the network executives in NYC have seen it. And now thanks to google you can watch it too- Hurry before it&amp;#039;s gone (Before the CIA poses as copyright owner and has it removed from the internet! - Unless they are really the copyright holders!? Ahem...) Anyway- It is very good quality in content and source, but something in it must have struck a nerve with the network to keep it from public. Furthermore, I wonder if the people in the video are still alive and have not been erased...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5afa342d68ff46dc6cdf71ff7445443c0f9dbad4","amp;dn":"RoswellConspiracyInvestigation_UNAIRED_DOC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5afa342d68ff46dc6cdf71ff7445443c0f9dbad4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,250,52,45,104,255,70,220,108,223,113,255,116,69,68,60,15,157,186,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
