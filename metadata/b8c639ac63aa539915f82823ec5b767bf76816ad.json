I won\\&amp;#039;t give away the story but suffice to say it will both shock and move you. I\\&amp;#039;ve never seen anything quite like it. \n\nDirector made the earlier, equally disturbing Young Poisoner\\&amp;#039;s Handbook and also \nRKO 281, Golden Globe winning HBO movie about Orson Welles.\n\nHere\\&amp;#039;s  an internet review:\n\nEvery now and then a short film comes along with such a fantastic \nstory that you wish it was feature length. Torte Bluma is one of \nthose films.\nPutting a personal perspective on the horrors of war, this little gem \nlooks terrific. The cinematography is equal to that of far more \nexpensive undertakings and the look is matched by the content, the \ndetails of which I won\\&amp;#039;t go far into for fear of spoiling the great \nnumber of surprises.\nA middle-aged man is doing a spot of woodwork. He calls to his \nbutler for tea and everything smacks of the genteel upper-middle-\nclasses until he bites into a slice of cake and ants scurry out.\nWhat happens next turns the film on its head and makes for \nsomething a very long way from Merchant Ivory. This fantastic \ndrama is made all the more powerful and chilling by the fact that it \nis based on a true story. Want to see man\\&amp;#039;s humanity - or lack of it \n- exposed?\nYou should. If you dare.\n\nAmber Wilkinson\n\nIOfilm\n\n\nDirector: Benjamin Ross\n\nActors: Stellan Skarsgard, Simon McBurney\n\n18 mins\n\nUSA 2005\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8c639ac63aa539915f82823ec5b767bf76816ad","amp;dn":"Torte+Bluma+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8c639ac63aa539915f82823ec5b767bf76816ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,198,57,172,99,170,83,153,21,248,40,35,236,91,118,123,247,104,22,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
