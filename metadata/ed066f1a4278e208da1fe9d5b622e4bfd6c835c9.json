And Who Shall Go to the Ball And What Shall Go to the Ball?\n4. &quot;Man from Reno&quot; with Goran Bregovic\n5. Various one-off soundtrack contributions\n\nEnjoy and please buy his proper albums!  Maybe he&amp;#039;ll be motivated to put out full-lengths a bit more frequently than every eleven years.  ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed066f1a4278e208da1fe9d5b622e4bfd6c835c9","amp;dn":"Scott+Walker+Rarities","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed066f1a4278e208da1fe9d5b622e4bfd6c835c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,6,111,26,66,120,226,8,218,31,233,213,182,34,228,191,214,200,53,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
