Since the start way back in 1999 they have contributed to form the genre aggro-metal. Having more than 100 gigs behind them they have created a reputation of being a live act supreme. Even before signing to Alabama Records they performed at renowned festivals as Arvikafestivalen, Rookie-Festival (Hultsfred), Metal Meet, Arosfestivalen and MoshFest (NO) to mention but a few.\n\nThe bands prior promo-CDs have been spread all over the world in thousands of copies. Fans in far away nations have put up their own ?Riot-Tribes? to salute the Swedes. The demand is particularly great in Scandinavia, Germany, USA and South America.\n\nSays Andreas NystrÃƒÂ¶m of Alabama Records ?Seventribe has got their audience in a stranglehold when performing live on stage. If you?ve ever had the chance to see their show you?ll know exactly what I am referring to. Seventribe is something out of the ordinary and we are extremely proud to release the debut album of this highly acclaimed metal act.?\n\nArtist: Seventribe\nTitle: Aggro necesse est\nRelease: 2007-03-26\nLabel: Alabama Records\nCat no: ALAB004\nFormat: CD\n\nTracklisting:\nNumber one\nI will never\nLovecrap\nEmpty inside\nDipshit\nThe deceitful race\nI deny\n7-souls\nBountykilla\nFate\nLie-decrease\nStronger than ever\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51fd8f40b277958839a64e06f872c32d91ac9afa","amp;dn":"Seventribe++-+Aggro+Necesse+Est.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51fd8f40b277958839a64e06f872c32d91ac9afa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,253,143,64,178,119,149,136,57,166,78,6,248,114,195,45,145,172,154,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
