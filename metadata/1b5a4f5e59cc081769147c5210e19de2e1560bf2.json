There is one major difference. I have taken the commentary from the DVD by George Lucas, Irvin Kershner, Ben Burtt, Dennis Muren, and Carrie Fisher and incorporated it into this copy. Also I added the chapter directory from the DVD. I often backup movies to DVD for archival purposes and I know many other people do as well so I have decided to split this movie into DVD friendly portions. I have incorporated a function called linking which is only available in the .MKV container into these files. So when both parts are played from the same directory they will play as one. If you select the second part to watch the movie will play from the beginning. The time code is also seamless between the two segments. The second part doesn\\&amp;#039;t begin at 0 with a new time code. Watching these two parts should be one seamless stream to the observer. This is why I have chosen to make this movie a .MKV instead of .mp4 as I usually do. So with this copy there is no need to have your HD Star Wars movie watching experience interrupted at some arbitrary point because you need to load the second part.\n\n\n\nAfter receiving a vision from Obi-Wan Kenobi and fleeing the ice world of Hoth with his friends after an Imperial attack, Luke Skywalker travels to the marsh planet of Dagobah, where he is instructed in the ways of the Force by the legendary Jedi master Yoda. Meanwhile, Han Solo and Princess Leia make their way to planet Bespin, where they are greeted by Han\\&amp;#039;s old friend, a shifty gambler named Lando Calrissian. Ambushed by the Empire shortly after their arrival, Han and his friends are imprisoned by Darth Vader. Luke leaves Dagobah to rescue his friends, and is met by Vader and a startling revelation.\n\n\n\nIMDB link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/\n\n\nDon\\&amp;#039;t forget to visit us at www.sharego.net!\n\nTotal Movie Size: 5.68 GB\n\nAVInaptic Report Part 1:\n\n[ About file ]\n\nName: The Empire Strikes Back Part 1.mkv\nDate: 26/09/2007 13:39:44\nSize: 4,510,463,187 bytes (4301.513 MB)\n\n[ Generic info ]\n\nPlay duration: 01:34:39 (5678.72 s)\nContainer type: matroska\nCreation time: 26/09/2007 17:35:41 UTC\nNumber of streams: 3\nType of stream nr. 1: video (V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC)\nType of stream nr. 2: audio (A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)) {Main}\nType of stream nr. 3: audio (A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)) {Commentary}\nAudio streams: 2\nMuxing Application: libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\nWriting Application: mkvmerge v2.1.0 (\\&amp;#039;Another Place To Fall\\&amp;#039;) built on Aug 19 2007 13:40:07\n\n[ Relevant data ]\n\nResolution: 1904 x 816\nWidth: multiple of 16\nHeight: multiple of 16\n\n[ Video track ]\n\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nResolution: 1904 x 816 (*)\nFrame aspect ratio: 7:3 = 2.333333 (~2.35:1)\nPixel aspect ratio: 1:1 = 1\nDisplay aspect ratio: 7:3 = 2.333333 (~2.35:1)\nFramerate: 23.976024 fps\n\n[ Audio track nr. 1 ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)\nChannels: 6\nSample rate: 24000 Hz\nOutput sample rate: 48000 Hz\n\n[ Audio track nr. 2 ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)\nChannels: 2\nSample rate: 24000 Hz\nOutput sample rate: 48000 Hz\n\n\nAVInaptic Report Part 2:\n\n\n[ About file ]\n\nName: The Empire Strikes Back Part 2.mkv\nDate: 26/09/2007 13:40:57\nSize: 1,594,966,137 bytes (1521.078 MB)\n\n[ Generic info ]\n\nPlay duration: 00:32:42 (1961.691 s)\nContainer type: matroska\nCreation time: 26/09/2007 17:39:44 UTC\nNumber of streams: 3\nType of stream nr. 1: video (V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC)\nType of stream nr. 2: audio (A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)) {Main}\nType of stream nr. 3: audio (A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)) {Commentary}\nAudio streams: 2\nMuxing Application: libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\nWriting Application: mkvmerge v2.1.0 (\\&amp;#039;Another Place To Fall\\&amp;#039;) built on Aug 19 2007 13:40:07\n\n[ Relevant data ]\n\nResolution: 1904 x 816\nWidth: multiple of 16\nHeight: multiple of 16\n\n[ Video track ]\n\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nResolution: 1904 x 816 (*)\nFrame aspect ratio: 7:3 = 2.333333 (~2.35:1)\nPixel aspect ratio: 1:1 = 1\nDisplay aspect ratio: 7:3 = 2.333333 (~2.35:1)\nFramerate: 23.976024 fps\n\n[ Audio track nr. 1 ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)\nChannels: 6\nSample rate: 24000 Hz\nOutput sample rate: 48000 Hz\n\n[ Audio track nr. 2 ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)\nChannels: 2\nSample rate: 24000 Hz\nOutput sample rate: 48000 Hz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b5a4f5e59cc081769147c5210e19de2e1560bf2","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+The+Empire+Strikes+Back+1080p+w%2F+Commentary+SeCtIoN8+%7B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b5a4f5e59cc081769147c5210e19de2e1560bf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,90,79,94,89,204,8,23,105,20,124,82,16,225,157,226,225,86,11,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
