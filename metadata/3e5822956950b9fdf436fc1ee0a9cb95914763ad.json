This is a rerelease of the various video game tourneys held in 2006 at Sakuracon in Seattle, WA.\nUnfortunately the sound was not set up properly, so all the videos are silent.\nSome videos are incomplete or otherwise not great. For this I apologize.\nThey are also somewhat large because it seems the deinterlacing filter causes the video to be difficult to compress.\nHopefully one year this process will be repeated, but with more success.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e5822956950b9fdf436fc1ee0a9cb95914763ad","amp;dn":"Sakuracon+2006+Video+Game+Tourney+Videos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e5822956950b9fdf436fc1ee0a9cb95914763ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,88,34,149,105,80,185,253,244,54,252,30,224,169,203,149,145,71,99,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
