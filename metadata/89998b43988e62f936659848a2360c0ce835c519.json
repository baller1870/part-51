The fantasy behind it makes the fans want to be the characters (ive always wanted to be a super saiyan preferably Gohan teenager). The characters are cool funny and slick. Some of the best are vegeta, Android 16 and Trunks. Its got comedy, tons of action cool stories and sub stories. What more can you ask for in 20 mins.\n\nThe only other sagas that can beat this would be the LOTR/Hobbit saga and Star Wars. The whole saga past to present kicks ass. Wish I had the cash to buy all the episodes and movies.\n\n\n\nNow you can get the whole series uncut, all the saga\\\\\\&amp;#039;s: \nSayan Saga\nNamek Saga\nCaptain Ginyu Saga\nFrieza Saga\nGarlic Jr Saga\nTrunks Saga\nAndroid Saga\nImperfect Cell Saga\nPerfect Cell Saga\nCell Games Saga\nGreat Saiyaman Saga \nWorld Tournament Saga\nBabidi Saga\nMajin Buu Saga\nFusion Saga\nKid Buu Saga\n\nEnjoy, and please seed !!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89998b43988e62f936659848a2360c0ce835c519","amp;dn":"Dragon+Ball+Z","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89998b43988e62f936659848a2360c0ce835c519","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,153,139,67,152,142,98,249,54,101,152,72,162,54,12,12,232,53,197,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
