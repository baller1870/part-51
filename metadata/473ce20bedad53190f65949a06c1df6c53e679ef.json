The fake setup.exe file was actually a self extracting executable that would launch the adware program silently in the background and install symantec antivirus so if you didn&amp;#039;t know better you would think you were ok when you were actually getting infected at the same time you were installing something that was supposed to protect you... disappointing, I know.\n\nSo, what I did was use WinRAR to extract the TRUE setup.exe file from the fake one and replace the fake one and then repacked it for your stress free enjoyment.\n\nHere&amp;#039;s how to install this\nFirst off, it doesn&amp;#039;t need a serial key in order to be installed so no need to ask for one.\nSecond, just use a program like WinRAR or WinZip to extract the contents of the .zip file.\nGo to the folder\n\\SAVVISTA\nlook for setup.exe and run it\n\neasy as pie :-D\n\nYou will of course need to download the lates virus definition updates from Symantec after the installation is complete.\n\n\nAGAIN I WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT THIS VERSION WILL ONLY WORK WITH WINDOWS VISTA SO DON&amp;#039;T TRY INSTALLING IT ON EARLIER VERSIONS OF WINDOWS BECAUSE IT WON&amp;#039;T WORK.\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions but I think this is pretty self explanatory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:473ce20bedad53190f65949a06c1df6c53e679ef","amp;dn":"Symantec+AntiVirus+Corporate+Edition+Version+10.2+Vista+-+Fixed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"473ce20bedad53190f65949a06c1df6c53e679ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,60,226,11,237,173,83,25,15,101,148,154,6,193,223,108,83,230,121,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
