Astral passages become grounded by appealing tempos that grow into lavish gestalts of land and sky. A terrain of hypnotic melodies is invaded by organic sincerity, producing a sonic landscape that blossoms with optimism and inviting tuneage.\n\nAn overwhelming warmth permeates this music, capturing human emotion and transforming cosmic aspirations into earthy sentiments. Catchy riffs filter through an insistent mist of ambience. Generally nebulous passages are invigorated by clever harmonics and attractive beats, bestowing body on that ambience and elevating the tunes to more substantial proportion.\n\nSome tracks explore global politics with sampled voices memorializing significant international events.\n\nI would put this release in the vien of Enigma styled New Age music.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8749eec71874cde8ec9011e556728692c06d7584","amp;dn":"Andreas+Akwara+%26+Bjorn+Lutz+-+Ambush+%5BNew+Age-2004%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8749eec71874cde8ec9011e556728692c06d7584","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,73,238,199,24,116,205,232,236,144,17,229,86,114,134,146,192,109,117,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
