As Theroux travels through \nthe weird and scary world of climate change, he talks to \nenvironmentalists, scientists and economists - including the previous \nChairman of the British arm of the oil company Shell, Lord Ron \nOxburgh - and meets people who have already had a taste of what \nglobal warming has in store for us all. This pertinent documentary \nexplores how the threats posed by climate change call for a radical \nre-thinking of our priorities.\n\n  To save the planet, scientists say we need to slash carbon dioxide \nemissions by at least 60% which leads Theroux to the unthinkable \nconclusion: that nuclear power may be the way to avert catastrophe \nas for all other avenues - like carbon sequestration or turbine \npower - it would seem that Earth has run out of time. \n\n_________________________________________________________________d0x__\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0861fcaa58b61d4d493691bd18d1e3495316dcb","amp;dn":"The+End+Of+The+World+As+We+Know+It+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0861fcaa58b61d4d493691bd18d1e3495316dcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,134,31,202,165,139,97,212,212,147,105,27,209,141,30,52,149,49,109,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
