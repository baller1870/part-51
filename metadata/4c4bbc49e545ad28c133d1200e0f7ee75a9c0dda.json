Fans are saying that this group is made up of the Toriyamas World staff under a different name, excluding the TW translator who works for Viz.&quot;\n\n\nLezette (17 Jan 2007 04:48 pm) wrote:\n\n&quot;And :O TW under a new name?

Even the OP-Karaoke got the same translation so I bet they got the same translator.\n\nEveryone who followed TWs releases should now follow DG.&quot; \n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c4bbc49e545ad28c133d1200e0f7ee75a9c0dda","amp;dn":"%5BTW%5D+Death+Note+EP13+%5B9EB29013%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c4bbc49e545ad28c133d1200e0f7ee75a9c0dda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,75,188,73,229,69,173,40,193,51,209,32,14,15,126,231,90,156,13,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
