It then goes through the parts of the kernel: Mach, which does the typical kernel work like memory management, scheduling and interprocess communication, BSD, which provides the POSIX-style syscall interface, file systems and networking to user mode, and I/O-Kit, the driver infrastructure written in C++. In the end, a short overview on how to extend the kernel with so-called KEXT will be given, as well as an introduction on how to hack the (Open Source) kernel code itself.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03e5330a96da4cc77d0f210a33721ba2ff3c8cc6","amp;dn":"24c3-2203-de-chaos_jahresrueckblick.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03e5330a96da4cc77d0f210a33721ba2ff3c8cc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,229,51,10,150,218,76,199,125,15,33,10,51,114,27,162,255,60,140,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
