So I started making my 1hour and a half music experience.\nI like various kinds of music and like to hear them intermixed. That is a risk no radio station takes and also not \nmany djs in the world. Till now only Paul Oakenfold has managed to marry many kinds and ages of music together.\n\nAnyways, hope you enjoy this mixed disks as much as I do.\nRemember that I am not professional, I do this as a hobby.\nThe date after MIXAMIX is the date I have started creating each of this cds. \nThe creation may take from just one day to many months.\n\n\n\nA few words about this MIXAMIX_20060815:\nOk Lads and Geds,\nHere you have my latest mix.
