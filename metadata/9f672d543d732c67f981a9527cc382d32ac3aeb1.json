Gomer&amp;#039;s innocence, naivete and low-key demeanor often got him into trouble, most frequently at the hands of his loud-mouthed superior, Sgt. Carter. Duke, Frankie, Lester and Larry were some of Gomer&amp;#039;s pals and fellow enlisted men at Camp Henderson, and Lou Anne Poovie was his sometimes girlfriend who worked as a singer at the Blue Bird Cafe, where Gomer and the boys often hung out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f672d543d732c67f981a9527cc382d32ac3aeb1","amp;dn":"Gomer+Pyle+USMC+S-2+D-4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f672d543d732c67f981a9527cc382d32ac3aeb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,103,45,84,61,115,44,103,249,129,169,82,124,195,130,211,42,195,174,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
