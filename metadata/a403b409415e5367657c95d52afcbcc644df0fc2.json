Steffen Gehring went on the road a gain as the live keyboardist for PLASTIC NOISE EXPERIENCE and remixed bands like PSYCHE, THE ETERNAL AFFLICT, P.N.E., OVNI, etc, while Julia Beyer contributed vocals to the comeback album and tour of THE ETERNAL AFFLICT and also did various other highly praised vocal contributions for MELOTRON, ROTERSAND, DISTORTED REALITY, etc. ??Today TECHNOIR breaks their far too long silence and proudly present their new EPCD taken from their forthcoming new album &quot;Deliberately Fragile&quot;. And what a come back! With their own &quot;Manifesto&quot;, the duo once more strengthens its status as one of the leading female-fronted Electropop-bands in the scene. The self-produced EP features terrific remixes from well-known and hot artists like HAUJOBB&amp;#039;s ingenious Daniel Myer, ROTERESAND, as well as a driving floor-filler version from Russia&amp;#039;s Electro-Superstar DJ RAM (VIRTUAL SERVER). ??Furthermore, the collaboration of TECHNOIR with the famous German Hip Hop-Producer DJ Rabauke (Fettes Brot, Eins Zwo) and House-Specialist DJ Delobbo proves the open-mindedness of the duo and will surely bring new colours to the scene. And last, but not least, the package is filled with even more captivating remixes from the German Synthpop-institution BEBORN BETON, along with two remixes from Steffen himself where he once again laid his gifted hands on the songs and added new and surprising facets. ??With a harder edge and a darker touch than previous releases, Steffen&amp;#039;s new songs feature that special melodic touch that perfectly suits Julia&amp;#039;s impressive vocal range. Whatever you expected, TECHNOIR will prove you better - see you in your favourite club!\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTechnoir - Deliberately Fragile - CD - 2007\n\nThe long awaited second album from excellent Electro Pop act Technoir : &quot;Deliberately Fragile&quot; delivers the perfect combination of ultra-melodic arrangements, breathless and intoxicating female vocals and groovy dancefloor beats.
