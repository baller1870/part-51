Just what you wanted to hear! But with humor and enthusiasm, she will show you how grammar can be fun and worth a little bit of your time. So, uncover your eyes and learn her lesson. This won?t hurt a bit\n\nAbout the author:\nJune Casagrande was born in March and lives in a small house. She worked as an editor and community news reporter before launching the self-syndicated weekly grammar column, ?A Word Please,? which appears in community newspapers in Southern California, Florida and Texas. She has written articles for a number of regional and national publications including the Los Angeles Times. June attended the University of South Florida, where she earned her bachelor?s degree. She attended the improv comedy school at the renowned Groundlings Theatre, where she flunked out (much tougher program). June lives in Pasadena, Calif., with an embarrassing number of cats (four) and a just-right number of men (one). &quot;Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies&quot; is her first book. She&amp;#039;s currently working on her second Penguin grammar book, a look at the 101 most-criticized usage choices; the working title is &quot;Mortal Syntax.&quot;\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____|\n\n\n-LEGAL TORRENTS\n\nPurpose:\n\ncreate a balance, share the already free stuff,\npublic domain works, freeware, free music,\nfree ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.\n\nshow the copyright owners that torrent\nwebsites shouldn&amp;#039;t bear the responsibility\nof what their users upload, torrent websites\nare very much similar to google..\n\nusers upload what they want to upload,\ndownload what they want to download,\nand search for what they want to search..\n\nby creating this balance and sharing the already free\nstuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____|","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:910336006a9a11c0861ccac9e8e21f50af1ee8f8","amp;dn":"%28PDF%29+%28Manifesto%29+Beyond+Snobbery+Grammar+Need+Not+Be+Cruel+to+B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"910336006a9a11c0861ccac9e8e21f50af1ee8f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,3,54,0,106,154,17,192,134,28,202,201,232,226,31,80,175,30,232,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
