Were they rock and roll pioneers ahead of their time or were they just good at stealing quality songs and ideas? Being a studio musician for several years before he formed Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Page had a talented knack for taking what was not his without giving proper credit. Some of these songs (Including Killing Floor and How Many More Years) actually resulted in lawsuits that ruled AGAINST Led Zeppelin. Most of these songs have not been available in one place until now. So, here they are, the best of the best. When you finish listening to this, you will never take Led Zeppelin&amp;#039;s word for it again. \n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.\tBabe I&amp;#039;m Gonna Leave You - Joan Baez\n2.\tYou Shook Me - Muddy Waters\n3.\tDazed And Confused - New Yardbirds\n4.\tBlack Waterside - Bert Jansch\n5.\tI Can&amp;#039;t Quit You Baby ?
