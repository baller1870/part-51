Coogans Bluff uses its structure both for humorous contrast and for developing a geneology of anti-social outcast from the clash between Clint Eastwoods enigmatic, dangerous Westerner and the pimps, crooks, hippies, and cops he meets in the big town. Not surprisingly, this is at once Don Siegels funniest and most violent work. A companion-piece to Madigan in its study of the effects of urbanism on individualism, Coogans Bluff is more relaxed than its predecessor, employing a wide and inventive variety of characters and locales. \n\nOther features \nInteractive Menus, Scene Access \n\nDVD5 UNTOUCHED \n\nIMDB:http://imdb.com/title/tt0062824/ \n\nFILMAFFINITY: http://www.filmaffinity.com/en/film582352.html \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ba1da335114759f7ec6f869ac8f447e3a909f09","amp;dn":"Coogans+Bluff+%28Clint+Eastwood%29+Multisubs%2BMultilanguaje","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ba1da335114759f7ec6f869ac8f447e3a909f09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,161,218,51,81,20,117,159,126,198,248,105,172,143,68,126,58,144,159,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
