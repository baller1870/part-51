He is immediately taken into custody and questioned. After some prodding, he recounts how he was on patrol with his friend Alexander Mackaye, who was set upon by seven German aircraft. Instead of staying to help, Decker fled into the clouds, leaving him to die. He learns that Mackaye survived and went on to become a great hero in World War II, saving many lives in the Blitz. In fact, Air Vice-Marshal Mackaye is on his way to inspect the base.\n\nDecker can&amp;#039;t see how Mackaye could have survived the dogfight, until one of his interrogators suggests he got help. Since there were no other friendly fighters in the sector, Decker figures that it had to have been him who saved Mackaye, so he escapes to his plane and flies back through the cloud. Later, when Mackaye arrives, he is stunned when he is shown Decker&amp;#039;s identification card. He reveals Decker did in fact save his life?at the cost of his own.\n\n\nMP4 Format for your IPOD \n\nPLEASE SEED! \n\nEnjoy! \n\nAntil0ck\n\n_______       ______________________      ______  \n___    |________  /___(_)__  /_  __ ________  /__\n__  /| |_  __   __/_  /__  /_  / / /  ___/_  //_/\n_  ___ |  / / / /_ _  / _  / / /_/ // /__ _  ,&lt;   \n/_/  |_/_/ /_/__/ /_/  /_/  ____/ ___/ /_/|_| ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:129dca859a8f703989b2031690a5e0cfb10d2b62","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+Episode+18-+The+last+filght","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"129dca859a8f703989b2031690a5e0cfb10d2b62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,157,202,133,154,143,112,57,137,178,3,22,144,165,224,207,177,13,43,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
