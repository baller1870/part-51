It opens with the main television news at 7:30PM, providing information about the communist party leader, Edward Gierek. The recurrent image, Orwellian in spirit, of security cameras watching people, organises the film. In the last scene the camera moves inside the surveillance room and presents various images of the station on multiple screens. Its political, Orwellian touches aside, Station is chiefly admired for its attention to detail, its portrayal of tired, almost inanimate faces, \\&quot;people looking for something\\&quot;, the reality that has nothing to do with the optimism of the television news. \n\n\nEnglish and brazilian portuguese subtitles\n\n\nwww.makingoff.org\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1364d16501f2c85be005e6196ad98adf62e07806","amp;dn":"Kieslowski+-+Dworzec+%28central+station%29+-+www.makingoff.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1364d16501f2c85be005e6196ad98adf62e07806","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,100,209,101,1,242,200,91,224,5,230,25,106,217,138,223,98,224,120,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
