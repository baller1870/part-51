Among the many people interviewed are UFO researchers Stanton Friedman and Ted Phillips, UFO abductees Betty Hill and Travis Walton, optical physicist Bruce Maccabee, and retired U.S. military officers Jesse Marcel and Wendelle Stevens. The documentary supports the view that alien visitors regularly come to Earth and have perhaps done so for centuries.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5de7573d2659f343e4026ec5581683564d1fb17d","amp;dn":"UFO%5C%27s+Are+Real.avi+%281979%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5de7573d2659f343e4026ec5581683564d1fb17d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,231,87,61,38,89,243,67,228,2,110,197,88,22,131,86,77,31,177,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
