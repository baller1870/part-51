Out come the cranksters and all of the tweeks.\nUp for weeks, but not really caring, out the back window a man is staring, into the dark he swears he hear voices... Up for five days, its his mind making noises...\n\nReally a fun song for anyone whose ever used meth.\n\n   ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92010a96390f1fee8688c6eba3ff46758baf6b9e","amp;dn":"T_PORTER_CRANKSTER.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92010a96390f1fee8688c6eba3ff46758baf6b9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,1,10,150,57,15,31,238,134,136,198,235,163,255,70,117,139,175,107,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
