So often these days horror movies just aren&amp;#039;t scary, they make you jump they have a little bit of atmosphere and that&amp;#039;s it, well this film was scary. It was tense, well acted, and the director made great use of the setting to scare the hell out of you. I don&amp;#039;t want to go in to a lot of detail in this review, as I don&amp;#039;t want to spoil the experience for anyone who reads it, and that is what this film is an experience I came out of the cinema shaking. This film is well worth your time. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7df635fb97c7b65428f4f92725edfb4d518cb3f5","amp;dn":"The+Decent+%282+parts%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7df635fb97c7b65428f4f92725edfb4d518cb3f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,246,53,251,151,199,182,84,40,244,249,39,37,237,251,77,81,140,179,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
