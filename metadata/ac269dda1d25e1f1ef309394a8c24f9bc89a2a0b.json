The film is an auditory nightmare and one which tries to objectively view schizophrenia and those who are affected by it.\n\nIt is a piece attempting to allow the audience to explore their own reservations and prejudices about people with mental illness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac269dda1d25e1f1ef309394a8c24f9bc89a2a0b","amp;dn":"Lodge+Kerrigan+-+Clean%2C+Shaven","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac269dda1d25e1f1ef309394a8c24f9bc89a2a0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,38,157,218,29,37,225,241,239,48,147,148,168,194,79,155,200,154,42,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
