In\naddition, &quot;The Confessions Tour&quot; DVD includes bonus footage, which did\nnot appear on the broadcast, including Madonna&amp;#039;s early classic hit\n&quot;Lucky Star&quot; as well as the full unedited version of the controversial\nperformance of &quot;Live To Tell.&quot; The &quot;Confessions&quot; DVD will have never\nbefore seen rehearsal footage and a unique photo gallery. The DVD was\ndirected by Jonus Akerlund. The show was directed for the stage by\nJamie King. Musical Director was Stuart Price.\n\n&quot;The pop spectacle of the year -- a politically charged combination of\nCirque du Soleil, performance-art commentary and dance party explosion\nthat more or less sums up everything she has been striving to say and\nshow this decade... it&amp;#039;s quite possibly the best production she&amp;#039;s ever\nconcocted,&quot; raved the Orange County Register in their review of\nMadonna&amp;#039;s show.\n\n&quot;I want to turn the world into one big dance floor,&quot; claimed the\nMaterial Girl when The Confessions Tour began. Now, the singer,\nsongwriter, video visionary, designer, producer, children&amp;#039;s book\nauthor and artist, who has enthralled millions of fans all over the\nworld and has sold 200 million plus CDs, is extending that commitment\nto the living rooms of the world.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:603857e82797bc2f4a7515f723962b0b2a99b849","amp;dn":"Madonna-The_Confessions_Tour-2007-RNS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"603857e82797bc2f4a7515f723962b0b2a99b849","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,56,87,232,39,151,188,47,74,117,21,247,35,150,43,11,42,153,184,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
