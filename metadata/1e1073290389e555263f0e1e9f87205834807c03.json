I ripped this from a burned without a track listing so most of the songs are just called numbers. If it really bothers you, check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_the_Country_Died and fix it. I think this also includes four extra songs. Highly recommended anyway!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e1073290389e555263f0e1e9f87205834807c03","amp;dn":"Subhumans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e1073290389e555263f0e1e9f87205834807c03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,16,115,41,3,137,229,85,38,63,14,30,159,135,32,88,52,128,124,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
