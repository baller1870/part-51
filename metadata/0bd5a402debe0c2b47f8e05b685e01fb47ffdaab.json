It is being developed by EA Los Angeles and is slated for release on the PC and Xbox 360 in September 2007,[1] and for the PlayStation 3 in November 2007.[2] The game takes place in the European theater of World War II, and is the first in the series to focus on paratrooper activities.\n\nIn the single-player mode, the player takes on the role of PFC Boyd Travers, a paratrooper in the US 82nd Airborne Division.[3] Missions include various insertions into Italy, northern France, the Netherlands and Germany, each one beginning with a jump behind enemy lines, and success requiring completion of given objectives. Airborne also features a multiplayer mode available for online play, where users have the choice of fighting for the Allies and parachuting down to the battlefield, or fighting for the Axis and starting on the ground, defending the position from enemy paratroopers.\n\nThe game uses a heavily-modified Unreal 3 engine.[4] Airborne employs a nonlinear gameplay style whereby the player can start the game anywhere in the map by directing where they land, as opposed to previous linear FPS games where the start point and direction is already laid out.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor:_Airborne&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor:_Airborne&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bd5a402debe0c2b47f8e05b685e01fb47ffdaab","amp;dn":"Medal+of+Honor+AIRBORNE+2007+%2FRIP%2F%2F+labudam%2F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bd5a402debe0c2b47f8e05b685e01fb47ffdaab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,213,164,2,222,190,12,43,71,248,224,91,104,94,1,251,71,255,218,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
