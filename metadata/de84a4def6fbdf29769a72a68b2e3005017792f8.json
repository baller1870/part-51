This is intended merely to give fans a more in-depth look at the upcoming game ÃƒÂ¢?? not to replace an actual retail copy.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Automatically detects and replaces the original (encrypted) eboot.bin file with the (unencrypted) boot.bin file (included in the original demo .cso file).\n- Automatically patches eboot.bin to allow longer zone and filter names to be used without corrupting the file (essentially allowing any starting location to work properly)\n- Allows users to select from 89 different starting locations (via a simple list)\n- Allows users to choose any of the 14 secret costumes or revert back to the original Travis costume (via a simple list)\n- Rarely crashes for absolutely no reason\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de84a4def6fbdf29769a72a68b2e3005017792f8","amp;dn":"Silent+Hill+Origins+Demo+Autopatch+Tool+-+SHODAT+0.10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de84a4def6fbdf29769a72a68b2e3005017792f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,132,164,222,246,251,223,41,118,154,114,166,139,46,48,5,1,119,146,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
