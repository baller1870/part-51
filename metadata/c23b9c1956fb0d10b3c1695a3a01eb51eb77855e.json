The series journeys through time, in a quest to understand and celebrate the unique ecological mosaic of the Rockies, giving the audience a sense of wonder and stewardship in its future. The approach is not linear. Weaving back and forth, from present to the past, Shining Mountains explores the natural wonders, cultural heritage and future of the Rockies in a well-paced and sometimes controversial composite of visions. Today&amp;#039;s foremost thinkers and elders speak to their care and concerns for this extraordinary environment. Shining Mountains draws on narrative from eminent scientists, adventurers, aboriginal elders, resource managers, conservationists and developers, all of whom are under the spell of the Great Divide.\n\n4 Episodes, Xvid AVI w/ MP3 Audio, 608x352, ~ 45 minutes each\n\nRipped from DVD\n\nNFB Link: http://www.nfb.ca/collection/films/fiche/?id=52947\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c23b9c1956fb0d10b3c1695a3a01eb51eb77855e","amp;dn":"Shining+Mountains+%282005+-+miniseries%29+4+Episodes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c23b9c1956fb0d10b3c1695a3a01eb51eb77855e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,59,156,25,86,251,13,16,179,193,105,90,58,1,235,81,235,119,133,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
