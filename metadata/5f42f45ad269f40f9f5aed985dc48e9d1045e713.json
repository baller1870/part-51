It is based on the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch, which was in turn inspired by the crimes of Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein. The film depicts the encounter between a secretary, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), who is in hiding at a motel after embezzling from her employer, and the motel's owner, the lonely Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). &quot;The Shower Scene&quot; has been studied, discussed, and referenced countless times in print and in film courses with debate focusing on why it is so terrifying and how it was produced, including how it passed the censors and who directed it.&quot; -Wikipedia\n\nThis is a DVD-R image that contains English and Hebrew subtitles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f42f45ad269f40f9f5aed985dc48e9d1045e713","amp;dn":"Psycho+1960+Alfred+Hitchcock+clowne+%5BDVD-R+with+Hebrew+Subs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f42f45ad269f40f9f5aed985dc48e9d1045e713","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,66,244,90,210,105,244,15,159,90,237,152,93,196,142,157,16,69,231,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
