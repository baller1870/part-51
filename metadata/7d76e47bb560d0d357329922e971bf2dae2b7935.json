His Party swept \nparliamentary elections.Now he can write his ticket to the future. But where \ndoes Vladimir Putin want to take Russia? We hear from two veteran \ncorrespondents. And...in order to put the Putin era in  context, we discuss \nthe book KHRUSHCHEV: A MAN AND HIS ERA. Brian talks with the Pulitzer prize \nwinning historian, William Taubman about the man who tried to humanize the \nSoviet system.\n\nThis past week, Russia held parliamentary elections. President Vladimir Putin&amp;#039;s \nParty, United Russia, won easily more than 60 percent of the votes despite \nallegations by European observers of irregularities. This victory is important \nbecause Putin, by law, has to step down from power in May after serving two \nterms. His future is unclear and so his Party&amp;#039;s majority now gives him lots of \nnew options. The West is now looking at Russia with increasing alarm, unsure \nhow to interpret Putin and his ambitions.That&amp;#039;s why we turn to two Russia \nhands here at the CBC: Don Murray, based in London and Alexandra Szacka in \nMoscow.\n\nDon Murray brings valuable perspective to the question of Putin, having \nreported from Russia during the exciting years of Gorbachev and Yeltsin. \nAlexandra Szacka is the CBC&amp;#039;s new reporter in Moscow. She brings to her \nassignment an exciting history. She lived in Communist Poland as a child. \nHer grandfather was sent to Stalin&amp;#039;s gulag in the 1930&amp;#039;s. And her father went \nto University in provincial Russia during the Khrushchev years. She has seen \nthe spectrum of Soviet history within her own family.We present first a short \nexcerpt from her report earlier this week on the Putin victory and then hear \nher thoughts on what&amp;#039;s ahead for Russia.\n\nVladimir Putin is among the last generation of Russian leaders raised under \nthe Soviet regime.He experienced, first hand, the communist system. And his \nworld view was shaped, partly, by having lived in a country closed off from \nthe rest of the world and which saw the West as an enemy. As a leader who \noften cites history, he has looked at Russia&amp;#039;s recent past --at the leadership \nof Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin--and has decided they made mistakes. \nWe know he&amp;#039;s an advocate of a strong, nationalist Russia and wants to revive \nits international influence.Every leader brings his own stamp to his era and \ncan shape history by the force of his personality. That&amp;#039;s what historian \nWilliam Taubman believes. He won a Pulitzer prize a couple of years ago for \nhis insightful portrait of Nikita Khrushchev, who ran the Soviet Union in the \n1960&amp;#039;s, when Putin was a young.\n\nKhrushchev is interesting because he represents a reformist strain in Russia. \nHis greatest achievement was denouncing Russia&amp;#039;s authoritarian past and trying \nto put a human face on Communism. He&amp;#039;s credited with having paved the way for \nGorbachev and the reforms of the late 1980&amp;#039;s.Brian met with Taubman recently \nand we talked about the lessons of Khrushchev and what mark Vladimir Putin \nmay leave on his own era.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Post Information\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPosted by............: festering leper\n\nPosted to............: alt.binaries.multimedia\n                       alt.binaries.tv\n                       alt.binaries.documentaries\n                       alt.binaries.multimedia.documentaries\n                       alt.binaries.tv.canadian\n\nRepost Policy........: None, sorry!
