This was a lawless time, full of uncertainty about everything including whether your life would be ended by a random criminal on the street. It also suggests the Russian disillusionment with the Chechen War (well, the first one of the 1990s).\n\nBalabanov has created an intense crime drama that attempts to answer Dostoyevsky&amp;#039;s &quot;eternal question&quot;: what does one do in a lawless society? Danila, the hero, has lost his innocence during the war in Chechnya. In this way he really represents all of Russia in that he has lost his heritage and his identity, and now must make his way in the new Russia. Like many others at the time, Danila turns to crime in order to survive.\n\nThe most heart-wrenching thing about &quot;Brother&quot; is that it has an incredible likeness to the reality of life in St. Petersburg in the early 1990s. Though on the surface it seems to be full of senseless violence, Danila&amp;#039;s search for identity (that mirrors Russia&amp;#039;s) calls for an honest picture of the hard life of the period.\n\n\nEnjoy !
