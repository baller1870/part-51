The new version was called \\&quot;5.7.0.5\\&quot; and became the band\\&amp;#039;s biggest hit.\n\n\\&quot;What A Night\\&quot; - This version is rare because it\\&amp;#039;s the Bside to \\&quot;She\\&amp;#039;s Got Style\\&quot;. \\&quot;What A Night\\&quot; wasn\\&amp;#039;t on the \\&quot;Book Early\\&quot; album to start with but was added on later pressings and then released as the follow-up to \\&quot;5.7.0.5\\&quot;. This first version is not exactly as on the What A Night A-side single and album version.\n\n\\&quot;The Day The Earth Caught Fire\\&quot; - The second most well-known City Boy song. This is the single version which cuts off before Mike Slamer\\&amp;#039;s solo.\n\n\\&quot;Telulah\\&quot; - B-side to \\&quot;Shake My Head and Leave\\&quot;. Not release on any album.\n\n\\&quot;Medicine\\&quot; - B-side to the \\&quot;What A Night\\&quot; single.\nNot relased on any album.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d34463ff4af2f466a0971a3adfbdb514da18175","amp;dn":"City+Boy+-+RARE+stuff","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d34463ff4af2f466a0971a3adfbdb514da18175","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,52,70,63,244,175,47,70,106,9,113,163,173,251,219,81,77,161,129,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
