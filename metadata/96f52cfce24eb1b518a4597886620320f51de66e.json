All warning and nag screens removed.\n                   We decided to keep all the bonus stuff, because that is we believe the purpose with \n                   an &quot;Extended Explosive Edition&quot; version some how. But just remember this: \n                   Extended scenes have hollow audio and aren&amp;#039;t exactly 100% on target.\n                   Extended scenes look like a decent telescene, because they aren&amp;#039;t 100% digitally remastered.\n                   So don&amp;#039;t hassle us with this now, blame the DVD Company for not doing a proper job. :P\n\n                   On the original DVD gives you a choice after pressing play, theatrical or extended.

It\n                   pauses the movie for a few seconds, but don&amp;#039;t worry it will run.\n                   Anyway....enjoy. ;)\n                    \n\n\n  PLOT...........: The Bourne Identity is the story of a man whose wounded body is discovered by fisherman \n                   who nurse him back to health. He can remember nothing and begins to try to rebuild his \n                   memory based on clues such as the Swiss bank account, the number of which, is implanted \n                   in his hip.
