After your plane crashes into icy\nuncharted waters, you discover a rusted bathysphere and descend into Rapture,\na city hidden beneath the sea. Constructed as an idealistic society for a\nhand picked group of scientists, artists and industrialists, the idealism\nis no more. Now the city is littered with corpses, wildly powerful\nguardians roam the corridors as little girls loot the dead, and genetically\nmutated citizens ambush you at every turn.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f58ba10142284fad67eb56ae487b0df9b6251c3","amp;dn":"BIOSHOCK_%2B_Crack+%28megaups.com%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f58ba10142284fad67eb56ae487b0df9b6251c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,88,186,16,20,34,132,250,214,126,181,106,228,135,176,223,155,98,81,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
