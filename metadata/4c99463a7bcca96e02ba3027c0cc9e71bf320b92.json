Lam Chi Chung, Tin Kai Man, Chan Kwok Kwan, and Bruce Leung, Stephen Chow&amp;#039;s collaborators in Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle, join forces with famous action star Terry Fan Siu Wong and singer/actress Emme Wong, who recently appeared in Confession of Pain. While a sequel to the Kung Fu Hustle is yet to be produced, fans of the action comedy genre may wish to watch King Fu Fighter, which has a similar setting and just-as-stunning action sequences!\n\nMa (Vanness Wu) is a young man searching for his kung fu expert father in 1930s Shanghai. Inheriting his father&amp;#039;s super strength, he secures a job at a martial arts house and befriends Fat (Lam Chi Chung). The two fall into a trap and the Shanghai triads want to hunt them down. Meanwhile, Ma also has a crush on singer Lung (Emme Wong), but will the love between them blossom? With so many different parties plotting against each other, will Ma survive all the conspiracies?\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c99463a7bcca96e02ba3027c0cc9e71bf320b92","amp;dn":"Kung+Fu+Fighter.2007.NTSC.DVDR+%28ISO+Version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c99463a7bcca96e02ba3027c0cc9e71bf320b92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,153,70,58,123,204,169,110,2,186,48,39,192,204,158,113,191,50,11,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
