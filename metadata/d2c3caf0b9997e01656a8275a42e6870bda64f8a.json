Just use the patch &amp; it&amp;#039;s running with a valid subscritpon.\n\nUnrar with 7-zip, then you get two zip&amp;#039;s &quot;DudeRisk Production&quot; is password protected so first unrar the &quot;Info.7z&quot; &amp; then read the notepad to get the password for &quot;DudeRisk Production.7z&quot; \n\nVersion 5.0.5.259 [Latest as of 16th September]\n\nInformation: NotePad\n\nMade by: DudeRisk Corp.\n\nMade on 14th September, 2007.\n\nUploaded on 16th September, 2007.\n\nThis was uploaded 16th September, 2007 on ThePirateBay.\n\n                       \n\n----------------------------FAQ-----------------------------------------------\n\nQ. How do I unrar a 7z archive?\n\nA. Use 7 Zip, you can download it from: http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?groupname=sevenzip&amp;filename=7z442.exe&amp;use_mirror=switch\n\nQ. How do I extract the files from a 7z. archive?\n\nA. If you got 7 Zip installed, then right click on a 7z. archive &amp; select &quot;Extract&quot;\n\nQ. Why did you password protect the 7z archive &quot;DudeRisk Production&quot;\n\nA. Because, many torrent sites try to host my torrent without permission to share on other sites.\n\nQ. Is this your last torrent?\n\nA. Of course not, soon a AntiSPYWARE Professional torrent will be uploaded =]\n\nQ. When I unrar, I get some weird installation system asking, where would you install this, what is that?\n\nA. That is Nullsoft Install System.\n\nQ. Why don&amp;#039;t you use better Setup programs like Winse installation?\n\nA. Because Nullsoft Install System is easier to use &amp; is free, but there is no problem to get Wise Installation.\n\n\n##################################################################################\n##                                                                              ##\n##                     DudeRisk Production.                                     ##          ##                                                                              ##                                                                              ##                                                                              ##\n##                                                                              ##\n##                                                                              ##\n##                                                                              ##\n##                                                                              ##\n##################################################################################\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2c3caf0b9997e01656a8275a42e6870bda64f8a","amp;dn":"Spyware+Doctor+V+5.0.5.259+%5BLatest%5D+DudeRisk+INC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2c3caf0b9997e01656a8275a42e6870bda64f8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,195,202,240,185,153,126,1,101,106,130,117,164,46,104,112,189,166,79,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
