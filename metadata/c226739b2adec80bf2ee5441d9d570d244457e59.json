That&amp;#039;s because when Roach tackles a subject--like the posthumous human body in her previous bestseller, Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers, or the soul in the winning Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife--she charges forth with such zeal, humor, and ingenuity that her students (er, readers) feel like they&amp;#039;re witnessing the most interesting thing on Earth. Who the heck would skip that? As Roach informs us in her introduction, &quot;This is a book for people who would like very much to believe in a soul and in an afterlife for it to hang around in, but who have trouble accepting these things on faith. It&amp;#039;s a giggly, random, utterly earthbound assault on our most ponderous unanswered question.&quot; Talk about truth in advertising. With that, Roach grabs us by the wrist and hauls butt to India, England, and various points in between in search of human spiritual ephemera, consulting an earnest bunch of scientists, mystics, psychics, and kooks along the way. It&amp;#039;s a heck of a journey and Roach, with one eyebrow mischievously cocked, is a fantastically entertaining tour guide, at once respectful and hilarious, dubious yet probing. And brother, does she bring the facts. Indeed, Spook&amp;#039;s myriad footnotes are nearly as riveting as the principal text. To wit: &quot;In reality, an X-ray of the head could not show the brain, because the skull blocks the rays. What appeared to be an X-ray of the folds and convolutions of a human brain inside a skull--an image circulated widely in 1896--was in fact an X-ray of artfully arranged cat intestines.&quot; Or this: &quot;Medical treatises were eminently more readable in Sanctorius&amp;#039;s day. Medicina statica delved fearlessly into subjects of unprecedented medical eccentricity: &amp;#039;Cucumbers, how prejudicial,&amp;#039; and the tantalizing &amp;#039;Leaping, its consequences.&amp;#039; There&amp;#039;s even a full-page, near-infomercial-quality plug for something called the Flesh-Brush.&quot; While rigid students of theology might take exception to Roach&amp;#039;s conclusions (namely, we&amp;#039;re just a bag of bones killing time before donning a soil blanket) it&amp;#039;s hard to imagine anyone not enjoying this impressively researched and immensely readable book. And since, as Roach suggests, each of us has only one go-round, we might as well waste downtime with something thoroughly fun. --Kim Hughes\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\nStarred Review. Roach made an exceptional debut two years ago with StiffÃƒÂ¢??it might seem a hard act to follow. Yet she has done it again: after her study of what becomes of our mortal coil after death, she now presents an equally smart, quirky, hilarious look at whether there is a soul that survives our physical demise. Roach perfectly balances her skepticism and her boundless curiosity with a sincere desire to know. She ranges into the oddest nooks and crannies of both science and belief (and scientists who believe), regaling the reader with tales of Duncan Macdougall, a respected surgeon who weighed consumptives at their moment of death to see if the escaping soul could be measured in ounces, and of female mediums who, during sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ances, extruded a substance called ectoplasm from their private parts (she even examines a piece of alleged ectoplasm archived at Cambridge University). She goes to school to learn to be a medium, subjects her brain to electromagnetic waves to see if they induce the experience of seeing ghosts and joins a group trying to record sounds made by the spirits of the Donner party. The text is littered with footnotes: tangential but delicious tidbits that Roach clearly couldn&amp;#039;t bear to leave out. She is an original who can enliven any subject with wit, keen reporting and a sly intelligence.\nCopyright Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
