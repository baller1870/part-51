More information at http://meetthegimp.org\n\nEpisode 11: RAW converting with UFRaw\n\nRAW conversion was a thing a lot of you wanted to know something about. And in this show I tell you how to use the program UFRaw to get RAW images into the Gimp. My job was coming a bit into the way - I had to build the schedule for my school. So this show contains some ?should be? outtakes and perhaps I have overlooked some stuff. Please feel free to ask - I will be glad to answer all your questions in a follow up show.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32c8ae63f63fe886ca68cff2058ff3bbc56b4b20","amp;dn":"%5C%22Meet+the+Gimp%21%5C%22+Videopodcast+Episode+11","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32c8ae63f63fe886ca68cff2058ff3bbc56b4b20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,200,174,99,246,63,232,134,202,104,207,242,5,143,243,187,197,107,75,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
