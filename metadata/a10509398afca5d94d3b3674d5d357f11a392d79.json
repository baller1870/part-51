I took something like 7000 photographs in two weeks when I was staying at my friend\\&amp;#039;s house in New York and at my parents\\&amp;#039; place in Newport, RI.  There\\&amp;#039;s no narrative here, just a lot of things I found in the house moving around like crazy.  I made a  randomly modulating squarewave drone with lots of reverb for the soundtrack.  Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a10509398afca5d94d3b3674d5d357f11a392d79","amp;dn":"Laika%282005%29+by+Kristjan+Zaklynsky","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a10509398afca5d94d3b3674d5d357f11a392d79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,5,9,57,138,252,165,217,77,59,54,116,213,211,87,241,26,57,45,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
