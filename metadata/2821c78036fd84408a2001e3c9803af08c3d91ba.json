He&amp;#039;s a former failed English literature student, a former taxi driver, and a former hit man for the Chicago mob. And through an unlucky series of events, he is currently a zombie slave of a voodoo priestess and the shirtless superhero of the afterlife - a place called Deadside. Five demonic serial killers have elected to marshal the forces of the undead and loose them upon the world of the living, or Liveside in voodoo talk.
