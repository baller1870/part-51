Dadan has a sister, Afrodita, that he desperately wants to see get married so they strike a deal: Zare is to marry her. But none of the two care much for an arranged marriage: Zare is in love with Ida, Afrodita is waiting for the man of her dreams.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b7455a1b4b118864d696a8df694221d611395aa","amp;dn":"Svart+katt+vit+katt+SWEsub-sklz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b7455a1b4b118864d696a8df694221d611395aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,116,85,161,180,177,24,134,77,105,106,141,246,148,34,29,97,19,149,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
