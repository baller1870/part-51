To read some of the writing from the \nFree Walking zines section of this website, where we also have PDFs \navailable for download. Freewalking.org will continue to develop as \na public documentation of walks and projects.\n\nINTHEWEATHER.ORG\nA map of a walk records the memory of a singular experience. \nThe map provides a route; when directions given by another are followed, \nthe route becomes a path. Walking becomes an exploration of the city at once private and shared.\n\nMelinda Fries and Bonnie Fortune share an interest in exploratory walking \nand have collaborated as In The Weather since 2004. \nThis year we published In the Weather self-guided walks/Chicago, \nwhich includes walking directions by 16 Chicagoans. \nThe booklet is dispensed freely at 10 locations throughout Chicago.\n\nIn 2005 we decided to collect walks from around the world, \nwith the In The Weather website being the result. \nWe&amp;#039;d love for you to participate and share the memory of a walk, \na favorite walk, or a walk you&amp;#039;d like to take.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e066258f2c109ff1a217a22a48c5f4a635c088ca","amp;dn":"freewalking+and+intheweather+publications+-+ART+BOOKLETS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e066258f2c109ff1a217a22a48c5f4a635c088ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,102,37,143,44,16,159,241,162,23,162,42,72,197,244,166,53,192,136,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
