This is my first try at uploading torrents, so gimme a break if it all goes pear shaped.\n\nJoeCartoon\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s a very talented guy, with a terrific sense of humour and great skills in what he does. He does have a thing about gerbils though! Yeah, what\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s that all about Joe! You\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;ll see what I mean.\n\nThe cartoons (not suitable for kids) last from a few seconds, to a couple of mins or so and are \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;a bit different\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;. Some of them have buttons on the screen for you to click on, to determine what happens next. Use the escape button on your keyboard to close any cartoons without close (X) buttons on the screen.\n\nI subscribed (yeah...paid) for these a long time ago, so I hope you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;ll enjoy them. Please visit his site to see all his updated cartoons (you cannot download them without paying) and maybe spend some dosh while you\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;re there. He\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s got some brill merchandise too. \n\nHave fun and as Joe would say...cheers \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039; beers!\n\nSnudge.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust to add...a few of my favs are..gerbilbar, goanna, joefish, joetoad, monkeylooker, nannahooter, stoneflies 1 &amp; 2 (must see), superfly 1 &amp; 2 and theboss (brilliant).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae2b1edc21a6c6590d792dcd4c28115e6e1636f5","amp;dn":"JoeCartoon+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae2b1edc21a6c6590d792dcd4c28115e6e1636f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,43,30,220,33,166,198,89,13,121,45,205,76,40,17,94,110,22,54,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
