The giggling doctor kills his victims with a surgical theme. His goal being to give one of the townfolk a heart transplant.\n\nDVD ripped by CAP2007\n\nNote: Yes, this is the new DVD from Warner Bros. that features a brand-new transfer but sadly they opted out of releasing the DVD with the full scope ratio that the back of the box and Warner Home Video clearly states. But for a slightly wider than fullscreen but not as wide as scope transfer, this one is definately worth checking out.\n\nAlso, there are a few noticeable differences in this version. The Universal logo AND the Largo Entertainment logo have been replaced by a short Intermedia logo. Hence the shorter running time. Other than that, it\\&amp;#039;s the same movie.\n\nAlso, the score album by Brian May and a special suite mixed from the album into 5.1 is also included for those who are interested.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3a52ed0be96ab5b2bcea75061f48d64844b28b4","amp;dn":"Dr.+Giggles+WS+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3a52ed0be96ab5b2bcea75061f48d64844b28b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,165,46,208,190,150,171,91,43,206,167,80,97,244,141,100,132,75,40,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
