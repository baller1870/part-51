Several new abilities have also been added for all classes.\n-  All pets now receive a percentage of their master\\\\\\&amp;#039;s armor, spell \n   damage, spell resistances, attack power, and stamina.\n-  Low-level spells cast by high-level players will receive smaller \n   bonuses from +healing and +spell damage.\n-  HoTs, DoTs, and channeled spells have been re balanced to receive a \n   more appropriate (higher) percentage of +spell damage and +healing.\n-  HoTs from different sources will now stack (i.e. multiple druids can\n   cast the Rejuvenation spell on 1 target).\n-  New item property \\\\\\&quot;Resilience\\\\\\&quot; has been introduced. Resilience \n   reduces your chance to be the victim of a critical strike, and \n   reduces the amount of damage critical strikes do to you.\n-  Weapon Skill now does the following:\n-  Weapon skill will no longer reduce the percentage damage lost due to\n   glancing.\n-  The player will gain 0.1% to their critical strike rating per weapon\n   skill against monsters above their level.\n-  When casting a buff on a low level target, the appropriate rank of \n   the buff will be automatically be applied.\n-  Crowd Control effects in PvP will last no longer than 12 seconds \n   instead of the full duration, with a chance of a heartbeat resist.\n-  Players will no longer lose faction when under the influence of \n   \\\\\\&quot;Mind Control\\\\\\&quot; or the Gnomish Mind Control Cap.\n\nPvP\n-  Honor System Revamp\n   Current honor totals have been reset.\n   Players may display their highest lifetime rank title (accessible \n   from character sheet).\n   Honor points earned each day may now be spent as a form of currency.\n   Check the PvP tab of your character sheet to see your honor \n   information.\n   PvP rewards are no longer unique.\n-  Marks of Honor earned from battlegrounds are no longer turned in for\n   reputation or honor.  They are now used in addition to honor points \n   in order to purchase rewards.\n-  Two New Arenas are now available in three different modes.\n   2v2, 3v3, and 5v5 matches\n   Players may queue up at Goblin NPC\\\\\\&amp;#039;s in Stormwind, Ironforge, \n   Orgrimmar, Undercity, and Gadgetzan\n\nDruids\n-  The talent \\\\\\&quot;Swiftmend\\\\\\&quot; will now include bonus healing from the \n   talents \\\\\\&quot;Improved Rejuvenation\\\\\\&quot; and \\\\\\&quot;Empowered Rejuvenation\\\\\\&quot;.\n\nHunters\n-  Traps can be set while in combat, but require a 2 second arming time.\n-  Auto shot will be automatically enabled if the Hunter steps out of \n   melee range while in combat with target.\n-  1 agility will now grant 1 ranged attack power.\n-  Auto shot is now reset when casting Aimed Shot.\n\nShaman\n-  Shaman with the appropriate talent spec are now able to dual-wield. \n   Both main and off-hand weapons can be affected by self-weapon buffs \n   such as Windfury.\n-  Rockbiter\\\\\\&amp;#039;s weapon functionality has been changed. It is now a \n   damage proc instead of a flat attack power bonus.\n-  Windfury Weapon and Rockbiter Weapon enchantments will only benefit\n   the weapon with the enchantment on it.\n\nWarlocks\n- Range of \\\\\\&quot;Drain Life\\\\\\&quot; and \\\\\\&quot;Drain Mana\\\\\\&quot; spells have been increased.\n\nWarriors\n-  Rage generation from dealing damage has been normalized.\n-  All Rage awards are averaged with our expected rage per swing \n   (adjusted for weapon speed).\n\nItems\n-  The \\\\\\&quot;Far Sight\\\\\\&quot; effect has changed so that the camera now zooms in\n   to a distant location, rather than instantly showing the distant \n   view. This also affects the items: Ultra-Spectropic Vision Goggles, \n   the Ornate Spyglass, and the Hunter ability \\\\\\&quot;Eagle Eye.\\\\\\&quot;\n-  Spells can now require either a totem item or a totem category item \n   to cast a spell. This means that the Enchanting Rods now count as \n   all of the lower level enchanting rods as well, so you only need a \n   single enchanting rod instead of all six. This also means that \n   \\\\\\&quot;Finkel\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Skinner\\\\\\&quot; now counts as a Skinning Knife. Several weapons \n   that are picks have been flagged as counting as a Mining pick as \n   well.\n-  Items that give bonuses, such as + to crit, have been modified to \n   adhere to a combat rating system.\n-  All current items will provide the exact same benefit from ratings \n   at level 60 as they provided before the ratings system.\n-  Thrown weapon items no longer stack, but use durability instead.

Now the cap on time required \n   to make an item in those professions is based on quality and level.\n-  New Max times required.\n   Level 31+ Green Items at least 8 sec\n   Level 31+ Blue Items at least 15 sec\n   Level 31+ Purple Items at least 25 sec \n   Skill level now determines what items you can disenchant.\n   Skill 1= Level 1-20\n   Skill  25= Level 20-25\n   Skill  50= Level 25-30\n   Skill  75= Level 30-35\n   Skill 100= Level 35-40\n   Skill 125= Level 40-45\n   Skill 150= Level 45-50\n   Skill 175= Level 50-55\n   Skill 200= Level 55-60\n   Skill 225= Level 60-65\n-  Players will no longer lose an item when attempting to disenchant \n   on a boat when the loading screen appears.\n\nUser Interface\n-  Meeting Stone gossip options have been removed from Innkeepers in \n   preparation for the new LFG system.\n-  LFG/LFM UI\n   Tips have been added to Loading Screen tips and new player tips\n   Meeting Stones now function similar to a Warlock Summon spell.\n   Player\\\\\\&amp;#039;s select party member to be summoned and right click the \n   stone.\n   A second party member then clicks the portal to summon.\n-  Enchanting UI has been vastly improved.\n-  Raid UI now supports frame for Main Tank.\n-  Spell Alert (Enemy Cast bar)\n   Defaults to off\n   Enabled through Interface Options\n   Displays targeted enemy\\\\\\&amp;#039;s cast bar when they are casting.\n   May also be displayed with \\\\\\&quot;V\\\\\\&quot; key functionality.\n-  Auto-loot may be enabled with just one click in the Interface \n   Options.\n-  Character sheet UI now displays more precise melee, ranged, and \n   spell stats.\n-  Players can now cast item targetable spells on items that are in \n   your action bar.
