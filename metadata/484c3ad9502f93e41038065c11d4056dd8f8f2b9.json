A Drop In The Gray - Certain Sculptures [1985]\n\nA Drop In The Gray were an 80s new wave/rock band. Certain Sculptures was released in 1985 and is one of the best albums of this style that came out in the 80s. New wave/rock bands of that era had a certain formula; guitars and synths and melodic tunes. Certain Sculptures is a must have album and just goes to show how much good stuff came out in the 80s but left unnoticed and neglected.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:484c3ad9502f93e41038065c11d4056dd8f8f2b9","amp;dn":"Rare+80s+-+Feat.+A+Drop+In+The+Gray+-+Certain+Sculptures+%5B1985%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"484c3ad9502f93e41038065c11d4056dd8f8f2b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,76,58,217,80,47,147,228,16,56,6,92,17,212,5,109,216,248,242,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
