It is illegal.&quot; - Former Serbian president Slobodan\nMilosevic.\n\nAnd so begins Milosevic on Trial. The doco spans four years, from\n2002 - 2006, during which time Slobodan Milosevic was tried at the\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for genocide, war crimes and crimes\nagainst humanity.\n\nDuring this period the filmmakers had exclusive access to key\nplayers: Milosevic&amp;#039;s legal adviser Dragoslav Ognjanovic (&quot;To be the\nlawyer of a man like him, it is a great honor.&quot; and prosecution\nattorney Geoffrey Nice (&quot;This trial is about the accused&amp;#039;s rise to\npower - power that was exercised without accountability,\nresponsibility or morality.&quot;\n\nIt was the prosecution&amp;#039;s job to prove that Slobodan Milosevic had\na hand in the deaths of 250,000 people across three wars in\nCroatia, Bosnia and Kosovo. In the end, the charges were never\nproven because Slobodan Milosevic died in custody of a heart attack.\n\nAs this intricate and detailed film shows, trying to prove the\ncharges was a mammoth task for the prosecution, given the\nrelatively short period of time allowed for the trial.\n\nThe film also grants viewers a fascinating insight into the mind\nof Milosevic, a man determined to defend himself by attacking the\nlegitimacy of the court, claim that foreign powers were behind\nthe wars and use the media to his advantage.\n\nIt is a confronting film, one that compels you to listen in horror\nto heart-wrenching testimony from massacre survivors and then see\nthe human side of Slobodan Milosevic: a devoted grandfather, a\nkindly father figure to his lawyer and an elderly man whose health\nultimately doesn&amp;#039;t stand up to the stress of the trial.\n\nMilosevic on Trial is international justice in action with all its\nsuccesses, failings, twists and turns laid bare for the viewer. It\nis gruesomely humorous in parts, as the accused and his witnesses\ncontinually rant at the judges, and ultimately it raises the\nquestion whether courts such as the International Criminal Tribunal\ncan ever truly achieve what they set out to do?\n\n____________________________________________________________Encoding__\n\nFile Name....: Milosevic on Trial (2007-TVRip-d0x).avi\nFile Size....: 499 MB (or 511,992 KB or 524,279,808 bytes)\nFrames.......: 544x304 (1.79:1) [=34:19] @ 0.217 bits/pixel\nVideo Codec..: XviD @ 895 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: MP3 @ 128 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) CBR\n_________________________________________________________________d0x__","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:496e0823666ad2769c4d419659368563726b0ab6","amp;dn":"Milosevic+on+Trial+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"496e0823666ad2769c4d419659368563726b0ab6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,110,8,35,102,106,210,118,156,77,65,150,89,54,133,99,114,107,10,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
