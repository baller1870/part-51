He is assigned to training a recon unit. Their cool, trendy and &amp;#039;hippy&amp;#039; approach to military life is a reminder to him that he is, in the words of his commanding officer, a major, &quot;an anachronism&quot; - useful only &quot;in case of war&quot;. Conveniently, a war does arise (the invasion of Grenada in October, 1983) and successfully tests both his usefulness and the effectiveness of the new recruits.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7fdb4a6e521eb0fc5c04f921c388989eef9d223","amp;dn":"Heartbreak+Ridge+%28El+sargento+de+hierro%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7fdb4a6e521eb0fc5c04f921c388989eef9d223","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,253,180,166,229,33,235,15,197,192,79,146,28,56,137,137,238,249,210,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
