Same sort of topics etc. But I always end up feeling as if I have received more information from Kevin&amp;#039;s 2-hour show, than what I&amp;#039;m getting from Coast&amp;#039;s 4-hour show.\n\nIf you like Coast To Coast AM, chances are that you will like this show, as well.\n\nLearn more @ www.kevinsmithshow.com\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36296bc05a6b852e0bc260a716b50250f7fabd9d","amp;dn":"Kevin+Smith+Show+%5B09.05.07%5D+Stephen+Bassett+-+Exopolitics.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36296bc05a6b852e0bc260a716b50250f7fabd9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,41,107,192,90,107,133,46,11,194,96,167,22,181,2,80,247,250,189,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
