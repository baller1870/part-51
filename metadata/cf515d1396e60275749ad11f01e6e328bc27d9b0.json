Gomer&amp;#039;s innocence, naivete and low-key demeanor often got him into trouble, most frequently at the hands of his loud-mouthed superior, Sgt. Carter. Duke, Frankie, Lester and Larry were some of Gomer&amp;#039;s pals and fellow enlisted men at Camp Henderson, and Lou Anne Poovie was his sometimes girlfriend who worked as a singer at the Blue Bird Cafe, where Gomer and the boys often hung out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf515d1396e60275749ad11f01e6e328bc27d9b0","amp;dn":"Gomer+Pyle+USMC+S-2+D-2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf515d1396e60275749ad11f01e6e328bc27d9b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,81,93,19,150,230,2,117,116,154,209,31,1,230,227,40,188,39,217,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
