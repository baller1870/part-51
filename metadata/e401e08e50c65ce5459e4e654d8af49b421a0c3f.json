Ventrilo is also the industry standard by which all others measure themselves as they attempt to imitate its features. \n\nBy offering surround sound positioning and special sound effects on a per user, per channel, per server or global configuration level the program provides each user the option to fully customize exactly how they wish to hear sounds from other users or events. \n\nVentrilo is best known for it&amp;#039;s superior sound quality and minimal use of CPU resources so as not to interfere with day to day operations of the computer or during online game competitions. It is also preferred for the simple user interface that any first time computer user can very quickly learn because the most commonly used features are immediately visible and can be activated with a single click of the mouse.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e401e08e50c65ce5459e4e654d8af49b421a0c3f","amp;dn":"Ventrilo-Client2.3.0-PV1.pbi+-+PC-BSD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e401e08e50c65ce5459e4e654d8af49b421a0c3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,1,224,142,80,198,92,229,69,158,78,101,77,138,244,155,66,26,12,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
