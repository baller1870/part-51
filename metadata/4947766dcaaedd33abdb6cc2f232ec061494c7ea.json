The drug&amp;#039;s effects often fool doctors, who declare the victims dead. Could this be the origin of the &quot;zombie&quot; legend? Alan embarks on a surprising and often surreal investigation of the turbulent social chaos that is Haiti during the revolution which ousted hated dictator &quot;Baby Doc&quot; Duvalier. Often a pawn in a greater game, Alan must decide what is science, what is superstition, and what is the unknown in a anarchistic society where police corruption and witch-doctory are commonplace.\n\nSYSTEM: PAL\n\nMENU: English, espaÃƒÂ±ol, french, italiano, portuguese\n\nAUDIO: English 2.0, EspaÃƒÂ±ol 2.0, French 2.0, Italiano 2.0\n\nSUBTITLES: EspaÃƒÂ±ol, English, French, Italiano, Portuguese\n\nRELATION ASPECT: 16:9, 1.85:1\n\nINFO EXTRA:\nTrailer.\n\nFORMAT: DVD5 =&gt; DVD5\n\nCOMPRESSION: No Compression.
