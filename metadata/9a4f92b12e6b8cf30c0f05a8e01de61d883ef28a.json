Different scales for x264 and XviD Q) \n\nAudio Source: 2.0 AC3 192kbps\nAudio Codec: MP3 Lame 3.97\nSettings: VBR Quality 4 (-V 4 --vbr-new) Joint Stereo\nNormalized: No\n\nSize: 350 MB\n\nComments:\nThe source is a really cheap NTSC DVD. It claims to be &quot;Digitally Remastered&quot;, but the transfer looks really cheap with lots of\nwhite dots and other artifects. The movie was encoded in 29.97 fps hard-dropdown, so I had to do a manual IVTC and then dropping\nthe duplicate frames. The DVD had a lot of light background to dark background effects, like as it wanted to look like it was really\nshown in a 1932 cinema, but this annoying effect is somewhat less prone in the encoded version, not sure if it&amp;#039;s because of the\nFluxsmooth filter or the encoder or what. I darkened the brightness slightly, so that the result would look less gray and worn out.\n\nThe movie is stored in a 1.7 GB VOB-file, and I doesn&amp;#039;t really want to use much space for the encoded version (because the source isn&amp;#039;t\ngood), hence the 350 MB encode. I used the x264 video codec, because I believe that it is relatively better than XviD at low bitrates.\nx264 takes more processor power than XviD to decode, but I don&amp;#039;t think that it will be an issue at this small size.\n\nThe movie itself is probably mostly for those of us that already likes Hitchcock&amp;#039;s movies. The plot is at times a bit too confusing, and\nyou can see that the final chase is a model (but is still pretty amazing for its time).
