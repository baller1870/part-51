So you can share your catalogs with your friends who don&amp;#039;t have this software. \n\nCD Catalog Expert uses Windows Shell technology. In other words, when you rightclick on your CDROM icon, there is a &quot;Add to Catalogs&quot; menu command, just like Winzip. \n\nClick the command and you can create your catalogs by a shortcut even the CD Catalog Expert isn&amp;#039;t running! This is useful if you want to keep track of a vast CD collection. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you like this upload then please be so kind to vote for my torrentsite.\n\nThanks in advance\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.uranking.com/vote.asp?member=46032&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.uranking.com/vote.asp?member=46032&lt;/a&gt;\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba12f9d170227058690abb1f2be6dd55d8bb2d31","amp;dn":"CD+Catalog+Expert+v9.2.7.515","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba12f9d170227058690abb1f2be6dd55d8bb2d31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,18,249,209,112,34,112,88,105,10,187,31,43,230,221,85,216,187,45,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
