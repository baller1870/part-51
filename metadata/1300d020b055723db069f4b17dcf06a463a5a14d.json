A longtime advocate for the environment, Gore presents a wide array of facts and information in a thoughtful and compelling way.  &quot;Al Gore strips his presentations of politics, laying out the facts for the audience to draw their own conclusions in a charming, funny and engaging style, and by the end has everyone on the edge of their seats, gripped by his haunting message,&quot; said Guggenheim.  An Inconvenient Truth is not a story of despair but rather a rallying cry to protect the one earth we all share.  &quot;It is now clear that we face a deepening global climate crisis that requires us to act boldly, quickly, and wisely,&quot; said Gore.  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1300d020b055723db069f4b17dcf06a463a5a14d","amp;dn":"An.Inconvenient.Truth.2006.SweSub.XviD-JESS.avi.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1300d020b055723db069f4b17dcf06a463a5a14d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,0,208,32,176,85,114,61,176,105,244,177,125,207,6,164,99,165,161,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
