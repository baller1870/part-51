One day, they discover that they have a visitor. He&amp;#039;s small, he&amp;#039;s furry, he&amp;#039;s arrogant, and he&amp;#039;s an alien from the planet Melmac. Unsure what to do, they name him ALF: Alien Life Form. Alf soon decides that as much as he misses his home planet, there&amp;#039;s a lot to be said for Earth: the Tanners are willing to concede anything as long as he doesn&amp;#039;t announce his presence. Oh yeah, the the Tanners also have a cat, which looks rather tasty...\n\nSummary written by Murray Chapman \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8aa65a21f4a5ccfb132947667fce8b593aa7d48b","amp;dn":"ALF+-+Season+4+-+eng+-+nosub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8aa65a21f4a5ccfb132947667fce8b593aa7d48b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,166,90,33,244,165,204,251,19,41,71,102,127,206,139,89,58,167,212,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
