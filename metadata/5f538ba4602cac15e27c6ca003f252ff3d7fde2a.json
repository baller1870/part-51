And it has\nresulted in so many changes and fixes that I decided to release this\nAI traffic package with its own name.\n\nSo here it is, &quot;SkyTraffic 2007 v1.0&quot;.\n\n\n\nThe required HDD space on install is now approx 6.89Gb.\n\n\n\nINFO ABOUT THIS RELEASE! \n=========================================================================\n\nThings that&amp;#039;s been changed:\n\n- Loads and loads of corrections made (callsigns etc.) \n\n- Removed duplicates aircrafts, airports and flightplans. \n\n- Cleanup and renaming of AI aircrafts folders. \n\n- Changed the Bangkok airport from VTBD (Don Muang) to VTBS (Suvarnabhumi)\n  in schedules as VTBD (Don Muang) has been closed since 27 September 2006\n  in real life.\n\n- New installer that takes care of some more work for you. \n  (Installing and uninstalling of AI aircrafts and traffic file in FS9) \n  IMPORTANT\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES! \n=========================================================================\n\nThis AI package won&amp;#039;t add any traffic to VTBD (Bangkok Don Muang Airport)\nsince that airport is closed in reality.\n\nInstead it use VTBS (Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport), which isn&amp;#039;t added in \nFS9 by default. That&amp;#039;s why it&amp;#039;s important that you install the nice freeware\nVTBS airport that comes with this package.\n\nThe freeware version is distributed and made by http://www.siamavsim.com. \n\nThe site is in Thai but look for &quot;VTBS 2006 Project&quot; and you find it. \nGet the airport there if it isn&amp;#039;t with this package. \n\nIf you need a translator you could always use this one:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thai-language.com/default.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thai-language.com/default.aspx&lt;/a&gt; \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHope you all enjoy this new release!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f538ba4602cac15e27c6ca003f252ff3d7fde2a","amp;dn":"FS2004+-+SkyTraffic+2007+v1.0+RELEASE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f538ba4602cac15e27c6ca003f252ff3d7fde2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,83,139,164,96,44,172,21,226,124,108,160,3,242,82,255,61,127,222,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
