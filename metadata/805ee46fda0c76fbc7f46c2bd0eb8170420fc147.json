Unsurprisingly there was a great air of expectancy amongst his fanbase for &amp;#039;Anomie &amp; Bonhomie&amp;#039; to be released. Well, those fans (who must be well into their thirties by now!) can now breathe a sigh of relief because thankfully Scritti Politti&amp;#039;s latest album is an impressive return. His voice hasn&amp;#039;t changed a bit; it still sounds rather effeminate but in a good way and it sounds beautiful on the slower tracks namely &amp;#039;First Goodbye&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Brushed With Oil, Dusted With Powder&amp;#039; which could easily have been recorded at the same time as his 1985 masterpiece &amp;#039;Cupid and Psyche &amp;#039;85&amp;#039;. Elsewhere, however, Gartside relies on collabarations with rapper Mos Def and in the main part it works surprisingly well; the rapper&amp;#039;s aggressive style versus Gartside gentle sighs working best on &amp;#039;Tinseltown To The Boogiedown&amp;#039;. Quality control is lowered slightly in the mid-section of the record but to sum up this is a good comeback and it is hoped that we don&amp;#039;t have to wait another 11 years for the next album; by which time hopefully Gartside will have shaved off the ridiculous goatee beard he appears to have cultivated during his hibernation!&quot;~ www.leonardslair.co.uk\n\n\nTracklist:\n1.
