They have also released a nice screensaver that allows users to download or import their own photos to be used in the screensaver. Unfortunately, they do not allow free downloads of widescreen photos. So here is my contribution!\n\nHere are 128 nature &amp; city scenes (128 is the maximum number of photos allowed per album in Webshots).\n\nThis archive contains 3 files:\n\nWebshotsWidescreen.rar: (the full size JPG files, in case you want to use the photos in another application) 209Mb.\n\nalbum-19999.rar: (Contains the proprietary format for the Webshots program. Simply extract this file to your Webshots Data directory found in the current user?s My Documents) 54Mb.\n\nDiStInCt.nfo: (this iNFOrmation file).\n\nDownload the free screensaver here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.webshots.com/samplers/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.webshots.com/samplers/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a4f1b42c2507c228d56eb831f9ac9653b5256e2","amp;dn":"WebShots+Widescreen+High+Resolution+Photo+Album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a4f1b42c2507c228d56eb831f9ac9653b5256e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,79,27,66,194,80,124,34,141,86,235,131,31,154,201,101,59,82,86,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
