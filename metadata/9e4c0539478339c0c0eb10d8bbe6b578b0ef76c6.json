One day, they discover that they have a visitor. He&amp;#039;s small, he&amp;#039;s furry, he&amp;#039;s arrogant, and he&amp;#039;s an alien from the planet Melmac. Unsure what to do, they name him ALF: Alien Life Form. Alf soon decides that as much as he misses his home planet, there&amp;#039;s a lot to be said for Earth: the Tanners are willing to concede anything as long as he doesn&amp;#039;t announce his presence. Oh yeah, the the Tanners also have a cat, which looks rather tasty...\n\nSummary written by Murray Chapman \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e4c0539478339c0c0eb10d8bbe6b578b0ef76c6","amp;dn":"ALF+-+Season+1+-+eng+-+nosub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e4c0539478339c0c0eb10d8bbe6b578b0ef76c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,76,5,57,71,131,57,192,192,235,16,216,187,230,181,120,176,239,118,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
