Then, do a restart! \nOtherwise, the crack won&amp;#039;t work, according to some people. \n==================================================================================\n\nToday, I came up with a great idea: To share my favorite anti-virus software with you, mainly because I care about you and your machine. LOL. Nah, seriously, it&amp;#039;s because it&amp;#039;s very small, fast and yet secure. Very nice application, especially if you are a gamer. Also, if you&amp;#039;re sick and tired of all these bloated &quot;security&quot; softwares from the &quot;big guys&quot; like Norton (Symantec) and McAfee (Network Associates), you should really give this one a try! \n\nFurthermore, I want to point out that for those of you who prefer optimal protection, here&amp;#039;s (http://www.wilderssecurity.com/showthread.php?t=37509) a great \ntutorial, written by &quot;Blackspear&quot; (the moderator of NOD32 Wilders Security Forum). This expert configuration will make sure that you don&amp;#039;t see *any* alerts popping up when a threat has been found, while protecting your machine with a boosted protection. I personally recommend this tutorial to every hardcore NOD32 user because it brings efficiency to a higher level. \n\nFinally, here&amp;#039;s a cool screenshot of the new up-coming software from Eset (it&amp;#039;s currently under development) for the curious ones: http://tech.cybernetnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/Nod32v3.gif\n\nFor further questions/thoughts on this subject, just drop a message or PM me. \nAnd, oh! No evil questions, please. Be nice! :) Creds to all seeders out there!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProgram Name      : NOD32 AntiVirus Standard Version\nProgram Version   : 2.70.23\nCompany           : Eset\nLanguage          : English\nRelease Date      : December 20, 2006\nSystem/OS         : Windows NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista (32-bit/64-bit)\nGuides/Manuals    : Installation Manual, Product Brochure\nCrack             : Patch (Cracked by Team nsane)\nOfficial Web Site : http://www.eset.com/\nSystem Requirement: ---------------------------------------------------\n       OS/System  : ?

Keep your important information safe &amp; stay productive with peace of mind. Running separate applications for viruses, hackers, adware, and spyware can slow your PC, be difficult to manage, and provide questionable protection. Beware of large, bloated internet security suites that consume hundreds of megabytes on your PC. \nThese typically exist because vendors have acquired products and &amp;#039;bundled&amp;#039; them together. In contrast, ESET NOD32 was designed from the core as a single, highly-optimized engine that works as a unified Anti-Threat system to protect against a broad spectrum of malware. Viruses, worms, spyware, and other malicious attacks, which are constantly evolving. ESET NOD32 utilizes patent-pending ThreatSenseÃ‚Â« Technology to detect tomorrow&amp;#039;s threats in real-time, by analyzing code execution for malicious intent - keeping you ahead of the malware-writers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:228197cbb83d6756130150b1c69690bedb482fac","amp;dn":"NOD32+AntiVirus+System+Standard+v2.70.23+%28Upped+by+JF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"228197cbb83d6756130150b1c69690bedb482fac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,129,151,203,184,61,103,86,19,1,80,177,198,150,144,190,219,72,47,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
