In 1536, after facing a mysterious, evil opponent, he survives a fatal stab wound and is banished from his village, for they believe his survival is the work of the Devil. Five years later, Macleod is met by Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez, a swordsman who teaches Macleod the awful truth; he is immortal, one of a race of many who can only die when the head is cut from the body. When one immortal takes the head of another, the loser&amp;#039;s power is absorbed into the winner. Ramirez teaches Macleod the ways of the sword, until Ramirez is tragically killed by Connor&amp;#039;s ultimate opponent, the evil Kurgan, a murderous immortal brute who lusts for the ultimate power of the immortals, &quot;The Prize&quot;; enough power to rule the earth forever. Connor fights his way through the centuries, until the time of the Gathering, when the few immortals who have survived the endless battles come together to fight until only one remains, and that winner will receive The Prize. The time: 1985. The place: New York City. The final fight is about to begin, and in the end, there can be only one. \n\n\nRuntime:  117 min  \nAudio:  AAC 2 channel\nVideo:  544 x 304  MPEG-4\nFile Size:  703,060 KB\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091203/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091203/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlander_%28franchise%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlander_%28franchise%29&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3a7d410db1a4271c3ec1afbb3f0b498c773bb5b","amp;dn":"Highlander+I+%281986%29_unclebuck59%28nerodigital%29+.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3a7d410db1a4271c3ec1afbb3f0b498c773bb5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,167,212,16,219,26,66,113,195,236,26,251,179,240,180,152,199,115,187,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
