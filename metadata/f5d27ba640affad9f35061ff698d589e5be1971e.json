Well, the major advantages are:\n\n* SAFETY - This downgrader has plenty of safety checks in place to try to avoid accidental bricks (but remember the previous warning)\n\n* CONVENIENCE - Because this downgrader works with an official firmware EBOOT.PBP file (included), and includes the TA-082 idstorage changer and HEN files.
