And only by a select few may these forces be harnessed! Seiya is a mortal from Japan who has been trained and has excelled. The time has now come for him to test his skills in battle and to claim the sacred cloth: cloth that will change the order of the universe; armor that will earn Seiya a place in the cosmos; cloth that will establish his rank among the Saints. Through a series of tournaments and trials, Seiya must not only defeat some of the most powerful fighters ever to set foot in the ring, but he must also defeat the demons within himself Long live the Saints! Long live Saint Seiya!\n\nRegion: PAL\n\nSoftware: DvDDecrypter and DvDRebuilder Pro + CEE.\n\nvisit www.dvdquorum.es\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:691c78aee924fc92e92a6b621a0514d478308986","amp;dn":"Saint+Seiya+DvD1%28spanish-japanish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"691c78aee924fc92e92a6b621a0514d478308986","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,28,120,174,233,36,252,146,233,42,107,98,26,5,20,212,120,48,137,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
