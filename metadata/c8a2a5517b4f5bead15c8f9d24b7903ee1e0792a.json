All emotions pass the revue. Friendship and hope survive all.\n\nCOMENTARY By Ollie501 from Dorset, England:\nPlanta 4a is a truly remarkable film. A coming of age drama, dealing with first love,  basketball, the usual childhood mischief, and above all, friendship. Basically a comedy, this  will definitely bring laughter, and maybe a few tears along the way? I can&amp;#039;t recall seeing a  coming of age drama with such a refreshing honesty suffused with sadness and humour since  &amp;#039;Stand By Me&amp;#039;. Oh, and by the way? it just happens to be set in the cancer ward of a hospital.\nIMDB-link......: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319917/\n\nDVD: PAL\nLANGUAGE: Spanish\nCOLORr: Color (Technicolor)\nSOUND MIX: Dolby Digital 5.1\nSUBT:  English\nVIDEO FORMAT: 1.85:1\nEXTRAS:  Making of, Registers Technique, it Registers Artistic, Photographic Gallery,  Filmographies, press notes.\nEliminated trailer with DVDRemake \nRIPPER: DVDRebuilder + HC (2 Pass)\n- Reduction Level for DVD-5: 57,2%\n- Overall Bitrate : 4.532Kbs\n- Space for Video : 3.940.256KB\n- HIGH/LOW/TYPICAL Bitrates: 4.992/1.638/4.532 Kbs\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8a2a5517b4f5bead15c8f9d24b7903ee1e0792a","amp;dn":"The+4th+Floor+%28USA%29+%28literal+English+title%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8a2a5517b4f5bead15c8f9d24b7903ee1e0792a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,162,165,81,123,79,91,234,209,92,143,157,36,183,144,62,225,224,121,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
