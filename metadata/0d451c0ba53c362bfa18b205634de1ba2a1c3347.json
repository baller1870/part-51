I have included 2 Applegeeks comics used in a direct reference. \n\nI just added them to the torrent as it pisses me off when things like this are in one big rar file. This way you can view them as they download.\n\nI know its not much but I got tired of taking and wanted to give back, This is what I got, I hope you guys and gals enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d451c0ba53c362bfa18b205634de1ba2a1c3347","amp;dn":"CTRL-ALT-DEL+Comic+Archive","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d451c0ba53c362bfa18b205634de1ba2a1c3347","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,69,28,11,165,60,54,43,250,24,178,5,99,77,225,186,42,28,51,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
