They met a number of years ago and from there have developed an extremly solid and fruitful partnership. After a few months of producing together they signed a deal with Dutch label, Sadie Records, they began to enter into the market and gain success. This gave the duo a boost and they started to produce two/three tunes a week. They then decided that it would be a good idea to build their own record company &amp;#039;Submission&amp;#039; and work together with Sadie to create a bigger market. The rest is history.\n\nAt present they have the likes of Anthony Pappa and Sander Kleinenberg adding their tracks to their new CD compilations, and have found a space in the record box&amp;#039;s of many well known DJ&amp;#039;s including the likes of Deep Dish, Sasha, John Digweed, Laurent Garnier and Hernan Cattaneo.\n\nSubmissions new CD &amp;#039;Submission Sessions&amp;#039; mixed by Pig + Dan featuring all exclusive material and will be available August 1st 2004. Submission events around worldwide featuring Pig &amp; Dan and other named DJ&amp;#039;s. Finishing the artist album for later this year. Plenty of twelve inch singles to come from Submission, Tecmission and Sadie Records / Orange Dance Company. &quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:896e2ba8a1ab5372001705f5b927614c1f03267c","amp;dn":"Eric+Prydz+Vs.+Pink+Floyd+-+Proper+Education+%28Pig+%26+Dan+Remix+20","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"896e2ba8a1ab5372001705f5b927614c1f03267c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,110,43,168,161,171,83,114,0,23,5,245,185,39,97,76,31,3,38,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
