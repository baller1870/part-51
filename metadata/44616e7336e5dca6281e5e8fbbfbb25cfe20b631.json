The aircrafts&amp;#039; typical third propulsion unit mounted at the tail is part of one of the most outstanding civil aviation developments in the las decades.\n\nThe aircraft is flown with a three-man crew in the cockpit consisting of the captain,the first officer and a flight engineer. Although the plane has seen a great deal of service,it appears to have lost little if its original charm.\n\nThis film consists of scenes from over 20 years of DC-10 history including many interesting pictures from the archives. \n\nThe highlight of this film centres on a flight with a DC-10 from Frankfurt to Beijing.\n\nHow is navigation carried out on board a DC-10, what duties does a flight engineer have to cope with and what takes place during 10 hour flight to Beijing? This film is  really interesting and not just for DC-10 fans.&quot;\n\n\n\nThis DVD is not so technical as DVDs from http://www.worldairroutes.com, \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.justplanes.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.justplanes.com&lt;/a&gt; or http://www.itvv.com but is very interesting, \n\nespecially for DC-10 fans,as my self.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44616e7336e5dca6281e5e8fbbfbb25cfe20b631","amp;dn":"Lufthansa+DC10-30+cockpit+flight+Frankfurt+Beijing+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44616e7336e5dca6281e5e8fbbfbb25cfe20b631","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,97,110,115,54,229,220,166,40,30,94,143,187,251,178,92,254,32,182,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
