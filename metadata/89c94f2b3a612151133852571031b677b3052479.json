Pennebaker documenting the same performance of the album, released in 1986. It is notable for containing several interviews with rock stars, and containing an art piece by Denny Dent doing a painting of Hendrix.\n\nIt contains his performance with his band, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. The setlist includes mainly, tracks from Are You Experienced?, as well as covers of Howlin&amp;#039; Wolf&amp;#039;s &quot;Killing Floor&quot;, Bob Dylan&amp;#039;s &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, B.B. King&amp;#039;s &quot;Rock Me Baby&quot; and Chip Taylor&amp;#039;s &quot;Wild Thing&quot;. The version of Wild Thing included here is one of the most notable performances of the whole list of live Hendrix, because of the &quot;burning&quot; style he used on the track.\n\nEnjoy...\n\nGrtz.
