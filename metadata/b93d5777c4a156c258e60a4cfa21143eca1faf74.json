No sooner or later, Wade is captured by the law in Bisbee and Evans finds himself one of the escorts who will take Wade to the 3:10 to Yuma train in Contention for the reward of $200. Evans quest for taking Wade to the station is not only for saving for his land but an inner battle that he can be more than just a naive rancher in the eyes of his impetuous and gunslinging son William Evans. The transport to Contention is hazardous and filled with ambushes from Indians, pursuits by Wade&amp;#039;s vengeful gang and Wade&amp;#039;s own conniving and surreptitious demeanor that makes the ride all more intense.\n\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b93d5777c4a156c258e60a4cfa21143eca1faf74","amp;dn":"3%3A10+to+Yuma+DvDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b93d5777c4a156c258e60a4cfa21143eca1faf74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,61,87,119,196,161,86,194,88,230,10,76,250,33,20,62,202,31,175,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
