Maria Isabel was one of more than 1,500 Guatemalan \nwomen who have been murdered in the last four years. This documentary\ninvestigates how a man can escape a rape charge if he marries his \nvictim provided she is over the age of 12 and having sex with a minor\nis only an offence if the girl can prove she is ÃƒÂ¢??honest&amp;#039; and did not\nprovoke the attack. In some Guatemalan communities it is accepted\nthat fathers can introduce their daughters to sex and a battered\nwife can only prosecute her husband if her injuries are visible for\nmore than ten days. \n\nIn this culture of violence, where women are the prey, attacks have \nbecome accepted, even common place. Their murderers know they stand \nlittle chance of being caught because most murders are never \ninvestigated and no one is charged. Today, in Guatemala City, barely\na day goes by that a mother, a student or a housewife isn&amp;#039;t found \ndead. Rosa Franco says she will not stop demanding justice for the \nmurder of her teenage daughter Maria Isabel even though both she \nand her teenage sons are constantly intimidated by those she thinks \nmay be responsible for her brutal killing.\n\n____________________________________________________________Encoding__\n\nFile Name....: Guatemala - Killers Paradise (2006-TVRip-d0x).avi\nFile Size....: 449 MB (or 460,786 KB or 471,844,864 bytes)\nFrames.......: 624x352 (1.77:1) [=39:22] @ 0.206 bits/pixel\nVideo Codec..: XviD @ 1130 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: MP3 @ 128 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) CBR \n_________________________________________________________________d0x__\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27a775acdd46da78e55cedcdb78d841f497a5abb","amp;dn":"Guatemala+-+Killers+Paradise","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27a775acdd46da78e55cedcdb78d841f497a5abb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,167,117,172,221,70,218,120,229,92,237,205,183,141,132,31,73,122,90,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
