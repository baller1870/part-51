Only the crappy Pan &amp; Scan.  The Pal version was WS however.  So I have converted the Pal version to NTSC, and Rebuilt the menu.  Unlike my other DVD conversion, I fully integrated the subs this time so they are all selectable.  Its almost a 1:1 copy of the PAL release.  The only difference is its missing 2.0 czech Audio and the theatrical trailer due to space limitations and I removed German and French subs as DVD-Lab pro only allows me to author with 8 subtitle tracks and I had to cut 2 of them.  I cut those 2 since there is a spoken language option for them.\n\nYou might notice a bit of black on the left hand side of the movie, this was part of the original PAL release, so its normal.  If your TV has overscan (which it probably does), then you most likly won&amp;#039;t see it and even if you do, its no big deal.  I also included a High quality cover scan and a .rar containing all the subs in .srt in case you want to make any adjustments.\n\nENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82caefaadc19e0507468d237052505b6f0d91148","amp;dn":"Timecop.WS.NTSC.1994","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82caefaadc19e0507468d237052505b6f0d91148","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,202,239,170,220,25,224,80,116,104,210,55,5,37,5,182,240,217,17,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
