Ever since his rise to power in a coup d&amp;#039;etat on \nFebruary 8, 1963, Saddam Hussein had marked the destiny of Iraq and \nthat of the most explosive region in the world: the Persian Gulf. Yet \nthis man and his country have remained an enigma for the nine \nsuccessive presidents who have occupied the White House over the same \nperiod. He has also represented a constant challenge for the CIA, \nwhich, having supported his rise to power, didn&amp;#039;t know how to, nor \nwere they able to, get rid of him. Saddam Hussein: America&amp;#039;s Best \nEnemy tells the story of this ambiguous relationship, through accounts\ngiven by those who were witness to and participants in those decades \nof violence. \n\n_________________________________________________________________d0x__\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2508cffb1a0db95b1d079302cd1354c941868217","amp;dn":"Saddam+Hussein+-+America%5C%27s+Best+Enemy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2508cffb1a0db95b1d079302cd1354c941868217","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,8,207,251,26,13,185,91,29,7,147,2,205,19,84,201,65,134,130,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
