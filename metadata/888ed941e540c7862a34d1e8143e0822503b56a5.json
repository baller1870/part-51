Many lamers hangin&amp;#039; around  \nsharing scene  releases on  public places such as  \nFXP-Pubs, DC++ hubs,  P2P  networks  and  so  on.  \nWE  DON&amp;#039;T  WANT  OUR  RELEASES  GETTiNG      \nSPREAD  TO  SUCH  LAME  PLACES!!!          \nThe psytrance scene is kinda small and needs YOUR  \nSUPPORT.

Please be honest and  \nsupport the  artists &amp; labels  to make more great  \nmusic in the future too.
