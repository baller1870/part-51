What they soon discover is that they aren\\'t alone...and it isn\\'t a German soldier that\\'s hunting them down. \nIDeathwatch makes an interesting comparison to another film with a remarkably similar set-up called THE BUNKER that came out around the same time concerning German Soldiers in WWII. I have a theory that if DEATHWATCH had remained purely psychological and THE BUNKER had gone in the direction of more explicit supernatural manifestations--if both films had traded certain characteristics--each film would be much stronger; as it is I prefer Deathwatch. There are some really creepy scenes and some of the performances quite well done; Jaime Bell does hysteria and ruined youth very well and Andy Serkis amazes with his growling psychotic brute.\n\nDirector  \tMichael J.
