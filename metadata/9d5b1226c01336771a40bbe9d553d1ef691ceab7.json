Just run the patch in the same directory as agent.exe\n2. Copy regkey.txt to the data folder (should also contain the agent.ini file)\n3. and of course, if you like it, buy it.\n   \nbasically all the same directions as the last one.\n\nI thank PEoPLE for the original crack and iND for the distrobution of the 4.0 version of agent.\nAll I did was adapt the crack that they did for 4.0 for 4.1 by reversing their crack.  \n\nIf you have a problem do the following:\n  \n/* Don&amp;#039;t type fake key manual. If it says invalid key on start,\n  Use notepad open Data\\AGENT.INI, \n  JUST DEL this line:\n  key=\n*/ -- Thanks again to the original groups for the info and original crack.  I just released it\n&amp;#039;cuz I figured people could use it.\n\nThanks.\nPeace\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d5b1226c01336771a40bbe9d553d1ef691ceab7","amp;dn":"Forte+Agent+4.1.1088+-+Crack-Prs.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d5b1226c01336771a40bbe9d553d1ef691ceab7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,91,18,38,192,19,54,119,26,64,187,233,213,83,209,239,105,28,234,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
