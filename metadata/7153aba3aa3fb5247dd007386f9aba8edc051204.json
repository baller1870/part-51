The     *\n *  movie centers around a group of astronauts who come     *\n *  across a spaceship inhabited by &quot;hibernating&quot; space-    *\n *  vampires. One crew-member returns from the excursion    *\n *  alive, and so does one of the space-vamps. Luckily for  *\n *  us guys, it&amp;#039;s the amazingly gorgeous Mathilda May, who  *\n *  spends all of her on-screen time butt-naked (YAY!!!).   *\n *  She is so spell-bindingly fantastic to look at, that I  *\n *  think I had to watch the film 3 times to pay attention  *\n *  to the plot. LIFEFORCE is a very original take on the   *\n *  whole vampire idea, and has some really cool effects    *\n *  that still stand up to this day. The whole story is     *\n *  interesting and well played, and is a film that I watch *\n *  on a pretty regular basis (and not just for the hot     *\n *  naked chick). Definitely worth checking out.            * \n *                                                          *\n * Cover Synopsis:                                          *\n *  From the director of Poltergeist and co-wrtier of Alien *\n *  comes a thrilling sci-fi adventure of explosive action  *\n *  and pulse-pounding suspense. With mind-blowing special  *\n *  effects (for 1985) by Oscar-winner John Dykstra,        *\n *  Lifeforce is a sci-fi extravaganza that delivers        *\n *  out-of-this-world excitement. A mission to investigate  *\n *  Halley&amp;#039;s Comet discovers an even more fascinating       *\n *  phenomenon: an alien spacecraft! After a deadly         *\n *  confrontation, the aliens travel to Earth where their   *\n *  seductive leader begins a terrifying campaign to drain  *\n *  the lifeforce of everyone she encounters. Her victims,  *\n *  in turn, continue the cycle, and soon the entire        *\n *  planet is in mortal danger.                             *\n *                                                          *\n *  IMDb:             &lt;a href=&quot; http://imdb.com/title/tt0089489/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://imdb.com/title/tt0089489/&lt;/a&gt;     *\n *  Rating:            5.7/10                               *\n *  Genre:             Sci-fi                               *\n *  Year:              1985                                 *\n *  Language:          English                              *\n *  Music by:          Henry Mancini                        *\n *  Director:          Tobe Hooper                          *\n *  Runtime:           1:56                                 *\n *  Format:            Widescreen                           *\n *                                                          *\n ************************************************************   *                                                          *\n * FILE INFORMATION                                         *\n *                                                          *\n * VIDEO                                                    *\n *  Resolution:        720*304                              *\n *  Encoder:           Xvid MPEG-4 Codec 2-pass             *\n *  Avg Bitrate:       1424                                 *\n *  Frame Rate:        29.97 fps                            *\n *                                                          *\n * AUDIO                                                    *\n *  Codec:             MP-3                                 *\n *  Bitrate:           128 kbps                             *\n *  Frequency:         44100 Hz                             *\n *  Channels:          2 (Stereo)                           *\n *                                                          *\n ************************************************************  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7153aba3aa3fb5247dd007386f9aba8edc051204","amp;dn":"Liveforce.1985.DVDRip.Xvid.MPEG4.MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7153aba3aa3fb5247dd007386f9aba8edc051204","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,83,171,163,170,63,181,36,125,208,7,56,111,154,186,142,220,5,18,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
