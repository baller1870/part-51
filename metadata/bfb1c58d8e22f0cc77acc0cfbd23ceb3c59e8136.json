Same sort of topics etc. But I always end up feeling as if I have received more information from Kevin&amp;#039;s 2-hour show, than what I&amp;#039;m getting from Coast&amp;#039;s 4-hour show.\n\nIf you like Coast To Coast AM, chances are that you will like this show, as well.\n\nLearn more @ www.kevinsmithshow.com\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfb1c58d8e22f0cc77acc0cfbd23ceb3c59e8136","amp;dn":"Kevin+Smith+Show+%5B09.12.07%5D+Michael+Schmicker+-+ESP.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfb1c58d8e22f0cc77acc0cfbd23ceb3c59e8136","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,177,197,141,142,34,240,204,119,172,192,207,189,35,206,179,197,158,129,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
