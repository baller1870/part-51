She&amp;#039;s called upon by the resistance to fly to the remote mountain city of Kaal, to pick up a spy named &quot;Sky No. 1&quot; (Derek Yee). He&amp;#039;s got information, provided by the city&amp;#039;s ruler, Youda, (Lowell Lo) on a Japanese poison gas plant in the works. However, things do not go smoothly: Ming Ming&amp;#039;s plane is damaged in a dogfight with the Japanese, and then she mistakes a transient con-artist (Richard Ng) for her contact. Eventually, all the major characters come together to defend the city against the Japanese, who show up with tanks and mortars for a wildly destructive final battle.\n\nCast: \tMichelle Yeoh  ||  Richard Ng Yiu-Hon  ||  Derek Yee Tung-Sing  ||  Lowell Lo Koon-Ting  ||  Lau Chin Dai  ||  Tetsuya Matsui  ||  Cheung Maan  ||  Hwang Jang Lee  ||  Guk Fung  ||  Fung Hak On  ||  Lo Meng  ||  Lee Man Tai  ||  Fung Ging Man  ||  Ng Yuk Sue  ||  Sam Wong Ming-Sing  ||  Chu Chi Ling  ||  Chan Ging  ||  Chang Yi  ||  Cheung Ging Boh  ||  Dang Taai Woh \n\n_________________\nDo not break the share chain!
