More information at http://meetthegimp.org\n\n\nEpisode 10: Rescuing the chapel from the rescue\n\nAt the last show I made two blunders. I used an untested encoding and killed the sound for a lot of you and I used a layer mask with a lot of gray in it where it didn?t belong. So the sea didn?t look good.\n\nIn this episode I correct that mistake and add a bit of burning and dodging to get parts of the image darker or lighter. I don?t use the burn and dodge tool but use again a layer for better control. A bonus tip for the readers of the blog: If you set the foreground colour at start to medium gray and select then ?foreground colour? as the layermask, you get around the step of filling the mask.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:150ed7d1988ac0f38204e0007f958ccc2c891005","amp;dn":"%5C%22Meet+the+Gimp%21%5C%22+Videopodcast+Episode+10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"150ed7d1988ac0f38204e0007f958ccc2c891005","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,14,215,209,152,138,192,243,130,4,224,0,127,149,140,204,44,137,16,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
