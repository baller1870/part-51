We also examine first-hand the so-called &quot;Anbar Awakening,&quot; a controversial partnership between U.S. soldiers and Sunni tribal leaders, many of whom who had previously been fighting the Americans. Some, including President Bush, are calling this a significant step forward in reestablishing peace and order in Iraq. Hear what soldiers on the ground have to say.\n\nWe first met the Third Infantry&amp;#039;s First Brigade from Georgia&amp;#039;s Fort Stewart in a NOW show broadcast last January, only weeks before they headed back to Iraq for the third deployment in four years. As the long months of the &quot;surge&quot; unfold, we see them fighting an elusive enemy that prefers roadside bombs to pitched battles, while back at home their newborns become toddlers, and birthdays and anniversaries come and go. With the personal and political effects of constant redeployment and re-strategizing apparent everywhere, are we at a turning point or a breaking point?\n\nmore info: http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/337/index.html\n\n==\nruntime = 55:08\nxvid.512x384.1382kbps.mp3.112.vbr\nfile size = 600MB\n\ned2k://|file|Iraq.Third.Time.Around.avi|628484096|192C93AF8EB7E7F471602B63AF1DE2FC|/\n\nSupport your local PBS Station by making a contribution or by purchasing their DVDs. \n==\nSoS = http://www.sonofshun.com/forums\n==\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/PropAgenda/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/PropAgenda/&lt;/a&gt;\nfor more docs\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c174fafae0a1d0dd1fcc148632a2d60b22f581a8","amp;dn":"PBS+NOW+Special+2007+09+14+Iraq+Third+Time+Around+TVRip+SoS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c174fafae0a1d0dd1fcc148632a2d60b22f581a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,116,250,250,224,161,208,221,31,204,20,134,50,162,214,11,34,245,129,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
