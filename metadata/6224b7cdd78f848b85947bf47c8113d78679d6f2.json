As a lone security agent players will return to A.I.D.A., a virtual\n   reality military training program, to prevent cyber-terrorists from taking\n   control of the program and gaining access to classified military information.\n   The hackers believe that AIDA shouldn&amp;#039;t be restricted for only government use.\n   The agent must use his abilities and combat skills to disinfect AIDA from the\n   hacker-introduced virus so he can escape the system. Across a variety of\n   enclosed and open-air levels, players will take on original enemies with an\n   all-new selection of firearms and explosives that lets them counter the\n   terrorist menace with more firepower than ever before. Up to eight players can\n   go head-to-head in the game&amp;#039;s new online multiplayer modes. \n\n --- -   -      -                 -             - -- - - -     - \n \n   Greetings:\n \n   STINKYCUBE - ECHELON - KALiSTO - PROJECTX - ANiMOTiON - WjR - GANT\n\n   CARAVAN - TYPHOON - USA - STARCUBE - MOONCUBE - TLF - iMBT - RVF - RS\n\n   LiGHTFORCE - DARKFORCE - SuperX360 - DMZ - THE REST!\n  _________________________\n /                        /\n/   Group Information:   /___________________________________________________/\n                                                                            //\n    Enjoy our fine psp titles!! contact us @: team.dmu(at)gmail.com         /\n    if you are in hk, you wish to help or @: team.dmu(at)hushmail.com      /\n    We are looking for:    100Mbit+ Affil Sites                           /\n                           HK/JP/EU Game Suppliers                       /\n________________________________________________________________________/___ _ \n                              ______                                        __\n___ ___ _    _    _ _________/     //_ nfo (c) Desert/Dezign - Since 1993 _/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6224b7cdd78f848b85947bf47c8113d78679d6f2","amp;dn":"Coded_Arms_Contagion_USA_PSP-DMU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6224b7cdd78f848b85947bf47c8113d78679d6f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,36,183,205,215,143,132,139,133,148,123,244,124,129,19,215,134,121,214,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
