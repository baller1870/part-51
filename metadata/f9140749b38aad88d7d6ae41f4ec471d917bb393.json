Rating:  \t\n  3 / 5 (based on 3 ratings).\n\nPlot:\tTwo brothers begin feuding after each starts his own kung fu school. However, it will be up to a boy--whom each has kicked out of their school for being in both at the same time--to save them from the vengence of the bully&amp;#039;s brother.\n\nOverview:\tWhat happens when you have two masters teaching one student? Trouble. Tung Wei (18 Fatal Strikes, Enter The Dragon) is a lad who wants to learn kung fu. He trains in two different styles: Hung Gar and Wing Chun. Everything is fine until a jealous master creates a rift between Tung&amp;#039;s two teachers, and he has to choose sides. But a bigger problem looms ahead. The Tiger Master, played by Philip Ko (Dragon On Fire, Fearless Dragons), wants to fight both men to the death. They&amp;#039;re no match for him, so Tung goes to the one man who can train him properly: Sammo Hung. Get ready for fists, kicks, flips, and laughs; alongside authentic kung fu training...\n\nCast: \tStephen Tung Wai  ||  Sammo Hung (Kam Bo)  ||  Lee Hoi Sang  ||  Phillip Ko Fei  ||  Chung Faat  ||  Wong Hang Sau  ||  Mang Hoi  ||  Dai Sai Aan  ||  Ho Pak Kwong  ||  Fung Ging Man  ||  Lam Ching Ying  ||  Wu Ma  ||  Austin Wai Tin-Chi  ||  Huang Ha  ||  Chan Lung \n\n_________________\nIf this torrent link is dead or not well seeded, PM me for a re-seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9140749b38aad88d7d6ae41f4ec471d917bb393","amp;dn":"%5BKung+Fu%5D+The+Kung+Fu+Master+%28Sammo+Hung%2C+1979%29+-+DVD%2FRmvb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9140749b38aad88d7d6ae41f4ec471d917bb393","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,20,7,73,179,138,173,136,215,214,174,65,244,236,71,29,145,123,179,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
