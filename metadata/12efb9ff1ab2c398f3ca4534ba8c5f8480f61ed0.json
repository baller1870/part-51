This UNDUB has\n  the USA english text with the original Japanese spoken dialog. \n  \n  Version 2.0 now also restores voices for the mini-event skits.\n  \n  Enjoy this great game the way it was meant to be played!\n  \n  NOTE: THIS IS AN UPGRADE PATCH FROM 1.0 OR 1.01(SYNCFIX) ONLY.\n        GET THE FULL 2.0 IF YOU DON&amp;#039;T HAVE ONE OF THOSE.\n  \n                    -- Release Notes --\n  \n  The USA release of ToA had skit voices disabled entirely because\n  they were too lazy to dub them.  Unfortunately providing the JP\n  skit voices was not enough to undo this.\n  \n  Figuring out what they changed took a lot of analysis, made extra\n  annoying due to a large amount of localization changes compiled\n  into the game ... something like looking for a particular needle\n  in a haystack full of needles.\n  \n  Fortunately, I got fresh motivation every time I saw one of those\n  mute skits; now you can thank me each time you hear one. ;)\n  \n  Event, skit, battle and movie voices are now Japanese.  Yes, the\n  few movies lack subtitles; live with it.  The temporarily missing\n  voice bug in 1.01 is also fixed.\n  \n  Hackers/coders want to contact me?  Look for a fluffy kitty.\n  \n                   *** USA PUBLISHERS ***\n  \n  Please stop ruining your games with such horrible english dubs!\n  We are forced to go to extremes like this because you are making\n  the games we love unplayable!\n  \n  Consider multi-language or special-edition releases with the\n  original high quality Japanese voices.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12efb9ff1ab2c398f3ca4534ba8c5f8480f61ed0","amp;dn":"Tales+of+the+Abyss+USA+UNDUB+2.0+PATCH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12efb9ff1ab2c398f3ca4534ba8c5f8480f61ed0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,239,185,255,26,178,195,152,243,202,69,52,186,140,95,132,128,246,30,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
