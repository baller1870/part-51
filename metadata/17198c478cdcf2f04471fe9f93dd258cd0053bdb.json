The facility\\&amp;#039;s clientele of decidedly less than \\&quot;average Joes\\&quot; is made up of a self-styled pirate, a scrawny nerd who dreams of impressing an unattainable cheerleader, an obsessive aficionado of obscure sports, a dim witted young man, and a cocky know it all who, of course, really knows nothing. \nPeter\\&amp;#039;s humble gym catches the eye of White Goodman (Ben Stiller), the power mullet sporting, Fu Manchud, egomaniacal owner of Globo Gym, a gleaming monolith of fitness. White intends to take over Average Joe\\&amp;#039;s, and Peter\\&amp;#039;s non existent bookkeeping is making it all too easy for him. A foreclosing bank has stationed attorney Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor) inside Average Joe\\&amp;#039;s to finalize Globo\\&amp;#039;s takeover of the gym. But Peter\\&amp;#039;s boyish charms win her over and Kate joins his team of social rejects to beat the odds and their own ineptitude to try to save Average Joe\\&amp;#039;s. How?
