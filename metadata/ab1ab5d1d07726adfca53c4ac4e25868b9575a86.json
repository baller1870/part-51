Apparently demonoid.com deletes torrents after 5 days of no seeding.\n\n\nSO......, I made my own torrent file.\nSame movie.\nI plan to keep it seeded so it doesn&amp;#039;t disappear.\n\n\nThis is a movie about the goals of the islamofacist terrorists.\nAll orthodox Muslims believe they should emulate the prophet Mohammad to conquer the world and make it a Muslim facist world.\n\nThis movie has mainstream television excerpts from Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq.  Translated to English you will start to comprehend what the terrorists want, why nothing we&amp;#039;ve done or will do have any bearing on their actions, and why huge numbers of Muslims support them.  This is their culture, they were raised with these messages since birth, and their religious duty.\n\nThis movie has some similarities to &quot;Islam - what the west needs to know&quot;, but it is different.\n\nEveryone needs to watch these movies.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab1ab5d1d07726adfca53c4ac4e25868b9575a86","amp;dn":"Obsession+Movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab1ab5d1d07726adfca53c4ac4e25868b9575a86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,26,181,209,208,119,38,173,252,165,60,74,196,226,88,104,185,87,90,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
