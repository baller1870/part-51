Fantastic computer graphics, bringing paleoclimate alive. Ancient oceans went stagnant and toxic during previous episodes of global warming - at that time because of too many volcanoes belching gas. These were the times when the bulk of Earth\\&amp;#039;s oil reserves were created in black slimy ocean sediments.\n\nThere is an amazing interview list of qualified geophysicists all saying the same message: melt the polar ice caps with man-made warming, and you will again have toxic stagnant oceans for about 250,000 years, as this the only way the planet knows to \\&quot;rapidly\\&quot; re-absorb all that SH!T we are pumping into our skies. \n\nWorld premiere on Australian national TV 24th May 2007.
