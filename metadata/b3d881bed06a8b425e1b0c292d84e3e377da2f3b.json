In the process, the audience is entertained with some of the funniest moments they encounter on screen. But it is not easy to sustain 120 minutes of comedy. During the rather long middle segment of our hero&amp;#039;s &quot;student&amp;#039;s life&quot; at the HKAPA, things slow down somewhat, due partly to the lack of driving drama and conflict. However, this segment closes in a high note, with a mysterious, Phantom-like (in spirit only, not in appearance) Anthony WONG Chiu-seng teaching Chim&amp;#039;s character how to look for drama in real life, right on the streets.\n\nThis is an exceptionally fine comedy from a master comedian who knows what he is doing. Charlene CHOI (the extrovert half of the &quot;Twins&quot;), who in real life did get apprenticed to Chim and became his protÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© in acting, passes her first test here. The huge cameo cast, drawn from both the cinema and theatre circles, contributes to making this movie the prime choice in summer festivities.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3d881bed06a8b425e1b0c292d84e3e377da2f3b","amp;dn":"Simply+Actors+%282007%29NTSC.DVDr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3d881bed06a8b425e1b0c292d84e3e377da2f3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,216,129,190,208,106,139,66,94,27,12,41,45,132,227,227,119,218,47,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
