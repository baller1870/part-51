Video is a good bit better then the \none previosly posted. If you are a fan of Aretha this is the one you want.\n\nThis is Aretha at age 26. Not very young but still early in her career. \nShe is very much the Reverend&amp;#039;s daughter and her style is as much gospel \nas soul.\n\nIt is 1968. Black and white. Poor lighting, two cameras and possibly not \neven stereo. The backup singers seems to have had no professional choreography. \nTheir moves are homely and awkward, but their singing is so much the better. \nThe band is as good as it gets.\n\nOverall it is not the ultimate in quality, but rare as a diamond, and just \nas lovely. Aretha and her group are particularly inspired on &quot;I Never Loved a Man&quot;. \n\nI believe this is the earliest surviving live performance of Aretha Franklin \ndone with any professionalism. The original recording was done by Swedish Television, \nand I recorded it on VHS tape from a TV rerun around the millennium. I had it on \nVHS tape for some six years before digitising it.\n\nThe Songs;\n1. Natural Woman\n2. Come Back Baby\n3. Dr Feelgood\n4. Since You&amp;#039;ve Been Gone\n5. I Never Loved a Man\n6. Chain of Fools\n7. Respect\nTotal of 26 min\n\nEnjoy it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dc4253fb866f8ebeda097c21e8ef5f5f75d8558","amp;dn":"Aretha+Franklin+in+Stockholm+1968.+_Redigitised%21_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dc4253fb866f8ebeda097c21e8ef5f5f75d8558","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,196,37,63,184,102,248,235,237,160,151,194,30,142,245,245,247,93,133,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
