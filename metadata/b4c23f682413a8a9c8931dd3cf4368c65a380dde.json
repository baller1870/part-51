In that time no other act has come\nclose to filling the void left by their split following the death of\nJohn Bonham just over a year later. What made Zeppelin so\nspecial is hard to pinpoint. Certainly the chemistry that existed\nbetween four distinct musical personalities played a large part\nin their inexorable rise and sustained power. But above their own\nawesome talents there lay an unparalleled understanding of music\nitself. Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, John Bonham and John Paul Jones\nmanaged to draw on a vast range of different influences and they\nseized upon the very essence of the music they loved. A number of\nthee influences are gathered here but in all honesty. this CD could\neasily have been a box set. Now there\\&amp;#039;s thought...\nMOJO, August 2004\n\nTrack List:\n01.
