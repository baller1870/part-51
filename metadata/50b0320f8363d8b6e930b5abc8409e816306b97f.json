This is a classic movie that I ripped from VHS that I bought from a video store that was going out of business.  This is a hard, EXTREMELY funny, comedy to find.  Here is a brief recap of what it is about:\n\nAn advertising firm, desperate to keep an account from a financially-ailing brewery, concocts a macho ad campaign centering on three losers who inadvertently prevent a robbery at a bar.\n\nThe commercials these guys make are priceless..  WHIP OUT YOUR NORBECKER!  Download this gem while you can.  Especially if you like beer movies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50b0320f8363d8b6e930b5abc8409e816306b97f","amp;dn":"Beer+-+1985.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50b0320f8363d8b6e930b5abc8409e816306b97f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,176,50,15,131,99,216,182,233,48,181,171,200,64,158,129,99,6,185,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
