It is the follow-up (not sequel) to Support Your Local Gunfighter.  James Garner plays a cowboy wandering through town on his way to Austalia.\n\nHarry Morgan, Bruce Dern, Walter Brennan, Joan Hackett and other great character actors and the soon to be stars.\n\nThe movie is great fun.\n\nRated old style PG.  You can let the kids watch.  They don&amp;#039;t even finish the words &quot;Horse ****&quot;.\n\nEnglish only, no subs. Avi format.  GREAT quality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b17795ecf16515641f2ac3508925e75b0e6b0a70","amp;dn":"Western+-+James+Garner+-+Support+Your+Local+Sheriff%281969%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b17795ecf16515641f2ac3508925e75b0e6b0a70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,119,149,236,241,101,21,100,31,42,195,80,137,37,231,91,14,107,10,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
