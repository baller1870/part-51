Top brain is the academic Jason Gideon, his more by-the-book operational right hand Aaron &quot;Hotch&quot; Hotchner; the still juvenile Dr. Spencer Reid is an erudite on everything except real life, Penelope Garcia a brilliant computer whiz who gets access to any database etc. As they are mobile, cooperation with local police and FBI agents is important but often poses jurisdictional and other problems, as do some witnesses and suspects. \n\n\n\n\nOther features\n\nInteractive Menus, Scene Access, Making of Criminal Minds , Inside Quantico &amp; The Criminal Mind, Meet Matthew &amp; Gray Gubler, Deleted scenes, Audio commentaries \n\nDirector: Guy Norman Bee, Gloria Muzio, FÃƒÂ©lix EnrÃƒÂ­quez AlcalÃƒÂ¡, Matt Earl Beesley, Charles Haid, John E.
