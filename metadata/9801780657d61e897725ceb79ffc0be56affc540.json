Lockerbie takes a critical look at some of both evidence and witnesses that would eventually figure at the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial in 2000: the MST?13 timer fragment, Edwin Bollier, Alan Feraday and Dr Thomas Hayes come under particular scrutiny. The CIA\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Vincent Cannistraro and the FBI\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Thomas Thurman are exposed to strong criticism by colleagues. The film disputes the accusation by Britain and America that Libya was behind the bombing, concluding instead that the bomb was most likely introduced onto the aircraft by an unwitting drug mule, Khaled Jafaar, in a CIA-protected suitcase. Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, former prime minister of Iran, lends his weight to the theory that the Lockerbie bombing was in retaliation for the shootdown by the USS Vincennes of an Iran Air passenger aircraft in July 1988.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maltese_Double_Cross_?_Lockerbie&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maltese_Double_Cross_?_Lockerbie&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9801780657d61e897725ceb79ffc0be56affc540","amp;dn":"The+Maltese+Double+Cross+-+Lockerbie+Documentary+WMV+VHS+rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9801780657d61e897725ceb79ffc0be56affc540","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,1,120,6,87,214,30,137,119,37,206,183,159,252,11,229,106,255,197,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
