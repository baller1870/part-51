Hyacinth&amp;#039;s passion for flawless entertaining unnerves her neighbor Elizabeth, who is often invited to the Bucket home for coffee. Elizabeth&amp;#039;s divorced brother Emmet, who also lives next door to the Buckets, tries to avoid Hyacinth because she breaks into song in his presence in the hope he&amp;#039;ll cast her in one of his &quot;little theater&quot; musical productions. \n\nSeason 1 \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSeason 1, Episode 1: Daddy&amp;#039;s Accident\nOriginal Air Date: 29 October 1990\n\n\n\nSeason 1, Episode 2: The New Vicar\nOriginal Air Date: 5 November 1990\n\n\n\nSeason 1, Episode 3: Stately Home\nOriginal Air Date: 12 November 1990\n\n\n\nSeason 1, Episode 4: The Charity Shop\nOriginal Air Date: 19 November 1990\n\n\n\nSeason 1, Episode 5: Daisy&amp;#039;s Toyboy\nOriginal Air Date: 26 November 1990\n\n\n\nSeason 1, Episode 6: The Christening\nOriginal Air Date: 3 December 1990\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSeason 2 \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSeason 2, Episode 1: A Strange Man\nOriginal Air Date: 1 September 1991\n\n\n\nSeason 2, Episode 2: Driving Mrs Fortescue\nOriginal Air Date: 8 September 1991\n\n\n\nSeason 2, Episode 3: The Candlelight Supper\nOriginal Air Date: 15 September 1991\n\n\n\nSeason 2, Episode 4: Hyacinth Tees Off\nOriginal Air Date: 22 September 1991\n\n\n\nSeason 2, Episode 5: Problems with Relatives\nOriginal Air Date: 29 September 1991\n\n\n\nSeason 2, Episode 6: Onslow&amp;#039;s Birthday\nOriginal Air Date: 6 October 1991\n\n\n\nSeason 2, Episode 7: Singing for Emmett\nOriginal Air Date: 13 October 1991\n\n\n\nSeason 2, Episode 8: The Toy Store\nOriginal Air Date: 20 October 1991\n\n\n\nSeason 2, Episode 9: The Three-Piece Suite\nOriginal Air Date: 27 October 1991\n\n\n\nSeason 2, Episode 10: A Picnic for Daddy\nOriginal Air Date: 4 October 1991\n\n\n\nSeason 2, Episode 11: The Father Christmas Suit\nOriginal Air Date: 25 December 1991\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb70de56c6e52a26e271c62c48c508b290117d0f","amp;dn":"KEEPING+UP+APPEARANCES+SEASON+1-2+DISC+1+NORDIC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb70de56c6e52a26e271c62c48c508b290117d0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,112,222,86,198,229,42,38,226,113,198,44,72,197,8,178,144,17,125,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
