Easy to understand. You can even make your own models (Characters - Player.. Enemy.. Ally.. Etc., Sprites, Decoration etc.)\n\nScript Editor (SED) - After making the level, and filling it with live models, you will have to do some coding to actually make them behave in a certain manner. The language of programming is C-Script (a very easy version of C) which can be learned  and mastered within a week. SED is the editor for C-Script language, and its really excellent..\n\n(To decrease size, reference manuals were ripped which can be downloaded from conitec download page for free..

GameStudio&amp;#039;s A6 virtual reality engine was developed in 2003. Due to its combined BSP-Tree and terrain renderer, it handles indoor and outdoor sceneries equally well. Its lighting engine supports static and dynamic shadows cast from moving light sources. The threefold culling algorithm renders huge worlds extremely fast even on old hardware. Programmers can use plugins for adding new effects and features.\n\nYou can use this acknex engine (WHICH IS IN-BUILT, you can find it in Bin Folder of installation dir.) to code in C++ (Microsoft VC++ or Borland C++ or whatever you like) instead of C-Script. But that is for very advanced users, for beginners C-Script is recommended.\n\nTHIS IS A PROFESSIONAL QUALITY ENGINE.. so if you can master the language, you will be able to make professional quality games!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1441c65f498c170c624a03b4f7d9b9648411ae6","amp;dn":"3D+GameStudio+A6+Pro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1441c65f498c170c624a03b4f7d9b9648411ae6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,68,28,101,244,152,193,112,198,36,160,59,79,125,155,150,72,65,26,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
