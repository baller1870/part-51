It is presented in a high-quality compressed format.\n\nNo noise-filtering of any kind has been done, so you get the sweet\nsound of a vinyl LP in a convenient digital format \n(analog-&gt;digital=Digilog?).  Some EQing has been done in order to \nimprove the overall sound quality.\n\nAlso, when burning these files to Compact Disc, remember to leave no\npauses between tracks, or else the &quot;flow&quot; will be interupted, which will \nmess up your whole day, and possibly taint your mojo.  A program such as\nNero Burning ROM is recommended.\n\nYou have been warned, Mwahahahahahaha!!!\n\n\n\nVillain S. Deeds, A.K.A. GraknÃƒÂ¶r the Oppressor, the Digilog?
