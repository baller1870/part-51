Later they were forced to abandon all of their sled dogs in an attempt to get back home safely. They apologized for not taking the dogs with them, but people were angry and upset that they left all those beloved dogs behind. A year later, when they returned to the Antarctic to search for the dogs, they found something incredible...two of the sled dogs were still alive, agains the odds of extreme weather conditions.\n\n---\n\nDisney remade the story as &quot;Eight Below.&quot;\nThis, the original story is more truthful to actual events (and brutal in comparison) although the film makers increased the actual number of dogs involved from 9 to 15 according to some sources. \n\nFor more info, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nankyoku_Monogatari\n\n=-=-=-=-=\n\nIMPORTANT INFO!\n\nThis is a re-seed of the original torrent uploaded to The Pirate Bay back in July (2006) and it is identical except it now includes the missing VOB file which was placed into a separate torrent when I discovered that discrepancy.\n\nIf you are trying to complete the version of the torrent that had the missing VOB file and you didn&amp;#039;t yet have that file, do this:\n\nCreate a blank file using Notepad and name it &quot;VIDEO_TS.VOB&quot; (without the quotes) and place it into the Antarctica VIDEO_TS folder with the rest of the files. Do not delete any of the files you would have already previously downloaded. Download the .torrent file for this version and tell your Bit Torrent client to save to the same folder as your original. Your Bit Torrent client will then verify the percentage and complete the torrent from whatever percentage you had achieved at that time.\n\nIf you are acquiring this video for the first time you need not do anything except download as usual.\n\nMy apologies to those of you on other trackers who were not able to complete the original file.\n\n=-=-=-=-=\nDisc Details\n=-=-=-=-=\n\nDVD9 (dual layer)\nRegion Free\nNo CSS\nNTSC\nAnamorphic Widescreen\nHong Kong, Macau release.\n\nSpoken Language: Japanese\nSubtitles:\nChinese Traditional\nChinese Simplified\nEnglish &amp; Chinese Traditional\n\nAudio:\nDTS (Japanese)\nDolby Digital 5.1 (Japanese)\nStereo (Cantonese)\n\nFeatures (Not English):\nCast Profile\nProduction Team Information\nKarafuto Dog\nFilm Awards\nPhoto Gallery\nOriginal Trailer\nChapters/Clip Selection\n\nNothing was stripped or disabled.\n\n=-=-=-=-=\n\nEnjoy!\n\nUraphake","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc1df060a5a94533297f5674800190f9c7c431c8","amp;dn":"Antarctica+%28Nankyoku+Monogatari%29+NTSC+%5BDVD9%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc1df060a5a94533297f5674800190f9c7c431c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,29,240,96,165,169,69,51,41,127,86,116,128,1,144,249,199,196,49,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
