Names like Charlie Feathers, Mac Curtis, Ray Campi, Billy Lee Riley, Don Woody, Sonny Burgess and many more, were revered amongst the fans, but unknown to the general public.\n\nThe programme tells how the music leapt out of the rock n roll `underground` and for a few short years, became the hottest new cult in pop music with major record companies signing new bands, as well as digging out long-lost rockabilly tracks from their vaults, for first-time release in the UK.\n\nIt also tells how thousands of rock n roll fans marched on BBC Broadcasting House in 1976, demanding to hear `their` music on the nations` airwaves and how this resulted in two unknown London pub DJs, Stuart Colman and Geoff Barker, being catapulted onto Radio 1, with a progamme that arguably kick-started the rockabilly movement.\n\nWe hear from Colman and Barker along with musicians from bands at the time, including rockabilly hit-makers Matchbox, The Jets, The Polecats and Shakin` Stevens: original American rockabilly artistes, MacCurtis and Sonny Burgess and key UK bands, Crazy Cavan and Flying Saucers and hear the story of rockabilly`s biggest hit, Jungle Rock by the obscure Hank Mizell.\n\nAlong with BBC archive sessions recorded for the Radio 1 programme which have not been aired since 1977, the programme rejoices in the times when, for a while, it seemed that rockabilly really did rule...OK?\n\nThe programme concludes with a look at Rockabilly today ..30 years after the revolution!\nMusic Played\n\nJohnny Burnette &amp; The Rock n Roll Trio / Rockabilly Boogie \nRockin` Rollin` Stone / Andy Starr \nRockin` Daddy / Sonny Fisher \nSlippin In / Eddie Bond, \nElvis, Scotty &amp; Bill / Baby Let`s Play House\nMac Curtis / If I Had Me A Woman\nCrazy Cavan &amp; The Rhythm Rockers?.Teddy Boy Rock N Roll\nCharlie Feathers / One Hand Loose\nCrazy Cavan / Rockabilly Star\nDon Woody / You`Re Barking Up The Wrong Tree:\nCarl Perkins / Put Your Cat Clothes On:\nBilly Lee Riley / Flying Saucers Rock N Roll:\nWebb Pierce / Teenage Boogie\nHank Mizell / Jungle Rock\nRay Campi / Tore Up\nThe Duals / Stick Shift:\nFlying Saucers / Piano Nellie:\nShaky / `It`S Rock N Roll (Theme)\nHank C Burnette / Spinning Rock Boogie\nCrazy Cavan / Wildest Cat In Town (BBC Session)\nMac Curtis / Ducktail:\nSonny Burgess / We Wanna Boogie;\nMatchbox / Rockabilly Rebel\nMac Curtis / Goosebumps (BBC Session)\nThe Jets / Yes Tonight Josephine:\nThe Polecats / Rockabilly Guy\nThe Polecats / John I`m Only Dancing\nRobert Gordon &amp; Link Wray / Red Hot:\nStray Cats / Runaway Boys\nDarrel Higham / Down The Line:\nJack Rabbit Slim / Jeeze Louise:\nFurious / The Asbo Shuffle:\n(Reprise ) Matchbox / Rockabilly Rebel\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73da09fe6999808c42486d27204ec8b2665aa30d","amp;dn":"When+Rockabilly+Ruled+OK.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73da09fe6999808c42486d27204ec8b2665aa30d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,218,9,254,105,153,128,140,66,72,109,39,32,78,200,178,102,90,163,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
