The murderer, a former army officer accused of mutiny when he refused to kill a group of women and children. The movie is the tale of their trek across the desert fighting against each other and with each other. The dialog was great, short and delivered impeccably by an incredible cast of characters. It has been a long while since I have seen such thoughtful, dramatic acting. The movie is shot mostly in the desert but it is all done beautifully and with exactly the right tone and feel. I enjoyed the period costumes and the fight scenes were extremely well choreographed. It is seldom that I watch a hollywood movie and come away feeling satisfied, I can only hope that Asia continues to pump out incredible movies like this one and that Hollywood will wise up and stop trying to feed me drivel like the Last Samurai.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0114a40a0690bb8f47628e2a520bfa3521bf28c","amp;dn":"Warriors+of+Heaven+and+Earth%5BDvd-Rip%5D%5BIngles%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0114a40a0690bb8f47628e2a520bfa3521bf28c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,17,74,64,160,105,11,184,244,118,40,226,165,32,191,163,82,27,242,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
