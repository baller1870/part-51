All for One and One for All!&quot; With that slogan, the Industrial Workers of the World, aka the Wobblies, took to organizing unskilled workers into one big union and changing the course of history. Along the way to winning an eight-hour workday and fair wages in the early 20th century, the Wobblies were one of the few unions to be racially and sexually integrated and often met with imprisonment, violence, and the privations of prolonged strikes. This award-winning film airs a provocative look at the forgotten American history of this most radical of unions, screening the unforgettable and still-fiery voices of Wobbly members--lumberjacks, migratory workers, and silk weavers--in their 70s, 80s, and 90s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcb818579d78ec356bde1500c1cfd8d967ceeb42","amp;dn":"The.Wobblies.1979.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcb818579d78ec356bde1500c1cfd8d967ceeb42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,184,24,87,157,120,236,53,107,222,21,0,193,207,216,217,103,206,235,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
