More information at http://meetthegimp.org\n\nEpisode 15: RAW to the rescue! Mini-HDR ;-)\n\nI shot some autumn scenes with a Lensbaby in a very mixed light condition. And I haven?t checked the histogram after this shot. It is the only one with the focus right on spot and a dreamy flair. The leaf in the center was overexposed in the JPG image - blown out highlights ruined the image.\n\nBut I had shot in JPG and NEF (Nikon?s RAW) - so I used UFRaw to produce a TIFF file with the right exposure of the leaf and blended it into the image with a layer mask. This is basically the way (pseudo-) HDR works. Take different parts of the image from differntly exposed photographs.\n\nA slight correction with the hue/saturation tool was necessary to adjust the colours. Cropping was done twice - a mistake made a correction necessary. So I covered some advanced options in cropping.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e9f6ed3f02819356ea6cc4deb1372bd0972a65a","amp;dn":"Meet+the+Gimp%21+Videopodcast+Episode+15","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e9f6ed3f02819356ea6cc4deb1372bd0972a65a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,159,110,211,240,40,25,53,110,166,204,77,235,19,114,189,9,114,166,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
