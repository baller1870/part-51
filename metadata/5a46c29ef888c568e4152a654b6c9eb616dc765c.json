The program also explores the tension between the high cost of scientific innovation and society&amp;#039;s need to keep drugs and health care affordable.\n\nThe launching point for this report is the story of how a group of frustrated senior citizens led the state of Maine into battle with the powerful pharmaceutical industry. Frustrated by the skyrocketing cost of their prescription drugs, hundreds of Maine seniors began organizing bus trips across the Canadian border, where they found they could purchase the exact same prescription drugs for a fraction of what they were paying in the United States. Having to make the journey was inconvenient enough, the seniors said; but it was when they learned that people in Mexico, Japan, Germany, and most other developed nations were also paying much lower prices for drugs invented in the U.S., that their frustration turned to outrage.\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/other/etc/synopsis.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/other/etc/synopsis.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTech Specs:\n\nGeneral #0 \nFileSize/String : 700 MiB \nFormat/String : Audio Video Interleave \nOveralBitRate/String : 1790 Kbps \nPlayTime/String : 54mn 39s \nEncoded_Application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release) \n\nVideo #0 \nCodec/String : XviD \nCodec/Info : XviD project \nBitRate/String : 1524 Kbps \nWidth : 624 \nHeight : 464 \nAspectRatio/String : 4/3 \nFrameRate/String : 29.97 fps \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.176 \n\nAudio #0 \nCodec/String : AC3 \nCodec/Info : Dolby AC3 \nBitRate/String : 256 Kbps \nBitRate_Mode : CBR \nChannel(s)/String : 2 channels \nSamplingRate/String : 48 KHz \n\n===============================================================================\nLearn the true nature of the world, come visit our huge dedicated e-library and forums @ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969/index.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.info/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.info/index.php&lt;/a&gt;\n===============================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a46c29ef888c568e4152a654b6c9eb616dc765c","amp;dn":"PBS.FRONTLINE.The.Other.Drug.War.XviD.AC3+%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a46c29ef888c568e4152a654b6c9eb616dc765c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,70,194,158,248,136,197,104,228,21,42,101,75,108,158,182,22,220,118,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
