On board also he is Professor Farnsworth (Billy West), a chiflado scientist whose ideas oscillate between the brilliant thing and madness; Hermes Conrad (Phil LaMarr), a bureaucrat with official license whose coldness towards the crew is clarified by its preoccupation by its lives, but because it does not wish to fill up a pile of forms of Death-during-gives solely if they do not return of a mission, and Amy Wong (Laure Tom), the scholarship holder of the crew, who among other things dedicates itself to be mona and to bind with Lieutenant Kif Kroker (Maurice LaMarche).\n\n\n\nAnyDVD, DVDRebuilder+CEE 4 pass\n\n\n\n\n\n- Reduction Level for DVD-5: 81.7%\n- Overall Bitrate : 4&amp;#039;524Kbs\n- Space for Video : 4&amp;#039;041&amp;#039;266KB\n- HIGH/LOW/TYPICAL Bitrates: 8&amp;#039;232/2&amp;#039;371/4&amp;#039;524 Kbs\n\n\n\nPLEASE VISIT WWW.DVDQUORUM.ES ÃƒÂ­ÃƒÂ­ÃƒÂ­NOW IN ENGLISH!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:974a978ea00bb96cb5e4672d68e721931270223f","amp;dn":"Futurama+Season+4+dvd3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"974a978ea00bb96cb5e4672d68e721931270223f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,74,151,142,160,11,185,108,181,228,103,45,104,231,33,147,18,112,34,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
