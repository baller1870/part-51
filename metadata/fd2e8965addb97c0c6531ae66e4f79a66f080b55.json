One year later, Eric is brought back to life - and guided by a crow - so that he can seek vengeance on these scummy lowlifes.\n\nAlthough the idea of revenge has been overdone for years in a variety of films, this film does have its bonuses; it&amp;#039;s done with style, it looks great, it has entertaining heroes and villains, and has a decent rock soundtrack. The death of Brandon Lee during filming gives an added sense of tragedy to the whole film. It&amp;#039;s so sad, thinking of what happened to him...\n\nI can also tell this was based on a comic book series; it does have that sort of look and feel to it.\n\nI think it deserves at least an eight out of ten. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd2e8965addb97c0c6531ae66e4f79a66f080b55","amp;dn":"Crow.DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd2e8965addb97c0c6531ae66e4f79a66f080b55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,46,137,101,173,219,151,192,198,83,26,230,110,79,121,166,111,8,11,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
