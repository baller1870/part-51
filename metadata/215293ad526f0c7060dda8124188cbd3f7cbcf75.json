So I started making my 1hour and a half music experience.\nI like various kinds of music and like to hear them intermixed. That is a risk no radio station takes and also not \nmany djs in the world. Till now only Paul Oakenfold has managed to marry many kinds and ages of music together.\n\nAnyways, hope you enjoy this mixed disks as much as I do.\nRemember that I am not professional, I do this as a hobby.\nThe date after MIXAMIX is the date I have started creating each of this cds. \nThe creation may take from just one day to many months.\n\nA few words about this MIXAMIX_20040417:\nso what&amp;#039;s up my friends! I see u liked my mixes so far so I continue spreading more stuff.\nAbout this cd now. Not a very fast paced mix. \nRythmic trippy songs. A new mix from myself on Nightmare on Wax - Play On. More on this BT,Moby, Prodigy,\nOakenfold, Neneh Chery - Buffulo Stance (new intro), Run DMC,Everything but the Girl, Man with No Name, Hybrid,\nSignet and Astral Projection give the trancy feeling to complete the whole image! \nStill wondering how it is possible to combine all this different kinds of music.\nJust download an listen to this mix.\n\nDj Mentzik (http://www.musicalgalaxy.com)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:215293ad526f0c7060dda8124188cbd3f7cbcf75","amp;dn":"DJ+MENTZIK+-+MIXAMIX_20040417","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"215293ad526f0c7060dda8124188cbd3f7cbcf75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,82,147,173,82,111,12,112,96,221,168,18,65,136,203,211,247,203,207,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
