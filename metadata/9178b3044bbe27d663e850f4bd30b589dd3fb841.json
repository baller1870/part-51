Michael sees himself as the office funnyman, a fount of business wisdom and his employees&amp;#039; cool friend. He has no clue that his staff merely tolerates his inappropriate behavior because he signs their paychecks. Michael acts as the obnoxious tour guide for an omni-present documentary crew who unflinchingly capture his many shortcomings along with Dunder Mifflin&amp;#039;s petty workplace politics, simmering romances and side-splittingly awkward moments. \n\nThis contains Seasons 1, 2, 3, and 4.  (Season four is only episodes 1-8)\nEvery Episode is in this.  MP4 format to save memory and it can be put right on your ipod.  Great video and audio quality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9178b3044bbe27d663e850f4bd30b589dd3fb841","amp;dn":"The+Office","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9178b3044bbe27d663e850f4bd30b589dd3fb841","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,120,179,4,75,190,39,214,99,232,80,244,189,48,181,137,221,63,184,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
