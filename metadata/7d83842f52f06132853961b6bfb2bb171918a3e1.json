We discover the actual roots of Christianity and  \u0019\n \u0018  find out what religious hierarchs have been hiding for over 2,000  \u0019\n \u0018  years. Michael Tsarion investigates the suppression of women, the  \u0019\n \u0018  ecocidal tendency and the corruption in high places. Since, as     \u0019\n \u0018  Michael Tsarion says, the world elites have allegiances to hidden  \u0019\n \u0018  cults and secret societies, how can we expect them to honor their  \u0019\n \u0018  professed duties to humanity? In this all-revealing presentation   \u0019\n \u0018  we discover that the modern religions and political ideologies     \u0019\n \u0018  morphed out of seven great cults of power which ruled the world    \u0019\n \u0018  for millennia. The most powerful of these Cults was the &quot;Stellar   \u0019\n \u0018  Cult,&quot; dominant for over 10,000 years. Christ and the other Magi   \u0019\n \u0018  were initiates of this Cult, which gave mankind such sciences as   \u0019\n \u0018  astrology, astromancy, and the Tarot. Known as &quot;Serpents,&quot; they    \u0019\n \u0018  were the architects of the great temple structures such as the     \u0019\n \u0018  pyramids and the Sphinx. After the great Cults became corrupted    \u0019\n \u0018  they eventually gave rise to the modern exploitative religious     \u0019\n \u0018  and political hierarchies that prey off society today. We are      \u0019\n \u0018  still controlled by the elite bloodlines of these secret orders    \u0019\n \u0018  which continue to lead the world toward ruin and chaos. In this    \u0019\n \u0018  astounding presentation, Michael Tsarion demonstrates how          \u0019\n \u0018  religion and politics work to shape both the events around you,    \u0019\n \u0018  and the thoughts within you. &quot;Astro-Theology&quot; reveals the nature   \u0019\n \u0018  of the psychic and spiritual desecration which covertly operates   \u0019\n \u0018  upon us daily, and unlike the majority of other experts and        \u0019\n \u0018  researchers, Michael offers provocative solutions to our social    \u0019\n \u0018  and psychic predicaments.                                          \u0019\n \u0018                                                                     \u0019\n Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®\n\n Ãƒâ€°Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½\u001eÃƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½\u000eÃƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½\u001eÃƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒâ€¹Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â»\n Ã‚Âº                                ÃƒÅ’Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹\n Ã‚Âº\u0010 C O M M E N T S            \u0011Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¼ Ã‚Âº\n ÃƒË†Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½ÃƒÅ Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½\u0010\n \u0018                                                                     \u0019\n \u0018  Michael Tsarion is a very knowledgeable and dedicated researcher   \u0019\n \u0018  in many areas.
