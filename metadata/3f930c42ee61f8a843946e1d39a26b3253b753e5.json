In the course of five hours, director Stuart Orme tells the epic tale of the idealistic young knight Ivanhoe (Steven Waddington) and his battle against the evil Templar Bois-Guilbert (Ciaran Hinds, whose thoughtful performance gives his dark character a compelling dimension). Caught between the rivalries and religious struggles are Ivanhoe&amp;#039;s betrothed Rowena (Victoria Smurfit) and the brave, beautiful Jewess healer Rebecca (Susan Lynch), who wins Ivanhoe&amp;#039;s heart with her courage.\nSet against the historical backdrop of a Britain straining under the corrupt rule of Prince John while Richard the Lionhearted fights in the Crusades, director Stuart Orme makes up for a small budget (the crowd scenes are somewhat skimpy) with sweep, scale, and the lush green British countryside of verdant forests and rolling hills, where ancient castles still stand.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f930c42ee61f8a843946e1d39a26b3253b753e5","amp;dn":"Ivanhoe.ep3of6.1997.BBC.DVDRip.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f930c42ee61f8a843946e1d39a26b3253b753e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,147,12,66,238,97,248,168,67,148,110,29,57,162,107,50,83,183,83,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
