It concerns the fate of two very young lovers who would do anything to be together.\n\nThe Montagues and the Capulets of Verona, Italy, are in the midst of a long-standing feud when Romeo Montague drops in on a masquerade party at the CapuletsÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½. While there he meets and woos the daughter of the house, Juliet. She likewise returns his passion, and their secret meeting later that night on her bedroom balcony begins a series of tragic events that no one could have foretold.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:488e5d75f54ce652272ff82cbfc4b2245a36e142","amp;dn":"Romeo+%26+Juliet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"488e5d75f54ce652272ff82cbfc4b2245a36e142","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,142,93,117,245,76,230,82,39,47,248,44,191,196,178,36,90,54,225,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
