Eleven-year old Billy Elliot, whose father and brother are participating in the strike, whose mother has died quite some time ago and whose grandmother is not completely aware of what\\&amp;#039;s going on, doesn\\&amp;#039;t like the brutal boxing lessons at school. Instead, he falls for the girls\\&amp;#039; ballet lessons. When his folks find out about this unusual love of his, Billy is in trouble. Being supported by the ballet teacher, Mrs. Wilkinson, he keeps on training secretly while the work situation as well as the problems at home get worse. Finally, Mrs. Wilkinson manages to get Billy an audition for the Royal Ballet School, but now he also has to open his heart to his family.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9731c7e4941d58a3a5d0ba6087a43329afc900c","amp;dn":"Billy.Elliot%282000%29PAL.DVDR.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9731c7e4941d58a3a5d0ba6087a43329afc900c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,115,28,126,73,65,213,138,58,93,11,166,8,122,67,50,154,252,144,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
