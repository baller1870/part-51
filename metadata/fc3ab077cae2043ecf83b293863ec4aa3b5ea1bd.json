Games were run and tested in Windows XP.\n\nSome of the games are good for a quick diversion, while others are deep and/or addictive types.\n\nIf you&amp;#039;re looking for a nice set of games to kill time on your laptop, some of which can be run in windowed mode, then grab this torrent!\n\nThe Games Include:\n\nLegend of Zelda Remake\nEclipse\nBurgertime Remake\nKnightlore\nGalaxy\nBlack Cauldron Remake\nBruce Lee\nKing&amp;#039;s Valley (Don&amp;#039;t worry, it has English, too)\nDeadly Rooms of Death\nJumpman Remake\nChaos\n\n...and More!\n\nMany you may not have heard of, but all are worth trying out.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc3ab077cae2043ecf83b293863ec4aa3b5ea1bd","amp;dn":"Game+Pack+for+Laptop+Users","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc3ab077cae2043ecf83b293863ec4aa3b5ea1bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,58,176,119,202,226,4,62,207,131,178,147,134,62,196,170,59,94,161,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
