Designed for use by persons without extensive knowledge and experience of accelerator technology, the book assumes a knowledge of elementary physics and mathematics and places its emphasis on how accelerators actually function and how they are used in cancer treatment. Coverage includes the history of development and application, general theory of acceleration, accelerator systems, radiation beam systems and associated equipment, performance characteristics, testing and use. The major modules of a representative medical accelerator are described, including principles of operation and how these models function collectively to produce electron and X-ray beams for radiotherapy.\n\n\nPublisher: McGraw-Hill Companies Health Professions Divi (September 1992)\nLanguage: English\nISBN: 0071054103\t\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img245.imageshack.us/img245/6523/covercm6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img245.imageshack.us/img245/6523/covercm6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img155.imageshack.us/img155/9681/pagesfrommedicalelectrogk7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img155.imageshack.us/img155/9681/pagesfrommedicalelectrogk7.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:303d8aebe350983540eaa9ccbc4024be9531a70f","amp;dn":"Medical+Electron+Accelerators.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"303d8aebe350983540eaa9ccbc4024be9531a70f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,61,138,235,227,80,152,53,64,234,169,204,188,64,36,190,149,49,167,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
