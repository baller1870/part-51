In order to expose the Bush administration for misleading the public about the Iraq war, Greenwald presents the stories of informed political figures, scientists, and intelligence officers. Includes interviews with former CIA operative Robert Baer, magazine editor David Corn, and former ambassador Joe Wilson. Features interviews with over two dozen experts, including weapons inspectors Scott Ritter and David Albright.
