The word &quot;metal,&quot; however, doesn&amp;#039;t immediately come to mind when Grohl&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;90s contributions are discussed; while Nirvana and the Foo Fighters both had metal influences, they weren&amp;#039;t metal bands in the strict sense -- they were more hard rock than metal. Of course, there has often been a fine line between metal and hard rock, which are closely related even though they aren&amp;#039;t exactly the same -- and given Grohl&amp;#039;s fondness for metal, a straight-up metal project like Probot was long overdue. This CD is neither grunge nor post-grunge; a definite departure from Nirvana and the Foo Fighters, Probot is metal all the way and features well-known headbanger vocalists like King Diamond, Max Cavalera (of Sepultura and Soulfly fame), and MotÃƒÂ¶rhead&amp;#039;s Lemmy Kilmister. Grohl&amp;#039;s idea was to feature different metalheads he has long admired, and by doing so, he ends up traveling all over the metal map. The drummer&amp;#039;s affection for thrash is evident when he joins forces with Kilmister on &quot;Shake Your Blood&quot; and Cronos (of Venom fame) on &quot;Centuries of War&quot;; meanwhile, Corrosion of Conformity icon Mike Dean&amp;#039;s inspired performance on &quot;Access Babylon&quot; takes the album into hardcore territory. Equally memorable are &quot;Red War&quot; (the ferocious, Sepultura-like alt-metal offering that features Cavalera) and &quot;Sweet Dreams,&quot; which features Diamond but is closer to the Black Sabbath worship of stoner rock than the Judas Priest-minded power metal that Diamond was known for in his &amp;#039;80s/early-&amp;#039;90s heyday. And whatever the style of metal that he is embracing, Grohl&amp;#039;s drumming is passionate throughout this fine album, which is as rewarding as it is unpredictable.\n\nNo password on the .rar file","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dd4aa992b4d41fc21e62e529f12c39a47e7895f","amp;dn":"Probot+LAME+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dd4aa992b4d41fc21e62e529f12c39a47e7895f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,212,170,153,43,77,65,252,33,230,46,82,159,18,195,154,71,231,137,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
