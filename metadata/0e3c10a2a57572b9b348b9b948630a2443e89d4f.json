Its origin is the U.S.S.R - I guess somewhere in the 1950&amp;#039;s. We all learned to love the songs and tunes. I have searched the internet for anything like this, but in vane. So therefore it is a great pleasure to share it with you all. The quality is of course far from CD-quality, but is very close to the original EP with all the hums and noise that goes with it.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nSide 1:\n01 THOSE EVENING BELLS - USSR State Academic Choir.mp3\n02 SONG ABOUT STEPAN RAZIN - I.
