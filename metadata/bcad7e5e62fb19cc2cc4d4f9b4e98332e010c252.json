They start singing MR. Tambourine Man, then as a surprise to everyone, BOB Dylan comes on stage!  This is a fantastic alternate version of a classic Bob Dylan Masterpiece.  Although the video quality isn&amp;#039;t great, the piece is still mind-blowing.\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcad7e5e62fb19cc2cc4d4f9b4e98332e010c252","amp;dn":"Bob+dylan+and+the+Byrds++Mr.+Tambourine+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcad7e5e62fb19cc2cc4d4f9b4e98332e010c252","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,173,126,94,98,251,25,204,44,196,212,249,180,233,131,50,224,16,194,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
