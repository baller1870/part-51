Same sort of topics etc. But I always end up feeling as if I have received more information from Kevin&amp;#039;s 2-hour show, than what I&amp;#039;m getting from Coast&amp;#039;s 4-hour show.\n\nIf you like Coast To Coast AM, chances are that you will like this show, as well.\n\nLearn more @ www.kevinsmithshow.com\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a019e689aba3beaf7558364529e837b88b961709","amp;dn":"Kevin+Smith+Show+%5B08.27.07%5D+-+Walter+Bosley.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a019e689aba3beaf7558364529e837b88b961709","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,25,230,137,171,163,190,175,117,88,54,69,41,232,55,184,139,150,23,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
