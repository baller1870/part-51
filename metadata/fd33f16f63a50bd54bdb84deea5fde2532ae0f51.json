The player  |\n          | takes on the role of an average citizen caught in the    |\n          | middle of the conflict as forces take control New York   |\n          | City and begin imprisoning innocent Americans, including |\n          | the player&amp;#039;s brother. With American military forces      |\n          | pushed out of New York City, an Underground Resistance   |\n          | movement in Manhattan is all that remains to retake      |\n          | control of the fallen city. Recruited by the Resistance, |\n          | the player will rise through the ranks by successfully   |\n          | completing missions with minimal casualties, ultimately  |\n          | becoming the charismatic leader of the group. Success    |\n          | will largely depend on the player&amp;#039;s ability to recruit   |\n          | and lead fellow New Yorkers to join in the battle, and   |\n          | eventually rescue his sibling and liberate the city. &lt;   |\n          | Use Loader 1.4, have memory card out or game will not    |\n          | load. start saving after you are in game. turn down      |\n          | music volume for best performance :) Happy Holidays &gt;    |\n          |                                                          |\n          |                                                          |\n          &gt;&gt; Release Notes:                                         &lt;&lt;)\n          |                                                          |\n          | Say hello to another fine MOONCUBE release, bringing you |\n          | the latest in NGC games for use on your unmodified and   |\n          | sexy GameCube system!
