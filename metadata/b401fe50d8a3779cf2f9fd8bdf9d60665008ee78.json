While the V0.81 release has performed rather well, there&amp;#039;s always room \nfor improvements, even though most of them are well hidden and probably won&amp;#039;t be noticed by most people. \n\n\nChanges/fixes in this release..\n--------------------------------\n- Major cleanup of code - the SH-D162C and SH-D163A now share the same code. This has been a painful job to do, but will make future updates so \n  much easier to handle. \n- The firmware is now based on the official TS05 firmware as opposed to TS04 for earlier releases.\n- Fixed a potential problem with the way that the RPC patching was done.\n- The laser head is now parked in a known and safe position following SS extraction. This should fix the clicking noise, that some people \n  experienced from time to time.\n- RPC settings stored in flash mem of the drive is now reset. This is not important for the patched firmware, but will leave the RPC settings as \n  they came from the factory, if someone, for some strange reason, should decide to go back to a non patched firmware.  \n- The feature list has been expanded to hold seperate feature entries for XBOX and XBOX360\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b401fe50d8a3779cf2f9fd8bdf9d60665008ee78","amp;dn":"Sh-d162C+Ts05+Kreon+v100+-+Polle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b401fe50d8a3779cf2f9fd8bdf9d60665008ee78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,1,254,80,216,163,119,156,242,249,253,139,223,157,96,102,80,8,238,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
