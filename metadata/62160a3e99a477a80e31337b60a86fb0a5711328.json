They do not find anybody in the camp, and they receive a blurred distress signal from the hills. Their sergeant gathers a rescue team, and they are attacked and trapped by deformed cannibals, having to fight to survive. An area of desolate New Mexico desert known as Sector 16 has become a testing site for the U.S. military,and a group of National Guard trainees are sent in to deliver supplies.Once arrived,the unit discovers an empty camp and decide to wander around and investigate until deformed mutants pop out of the hills to slaughter the intruders.Alexander Aja&amp;#039;s remake of Wes Craven&amp;#039;s 1977 horror classic was exciting and gruesomely violent.This is not the case with &quot;The Hills Have Eyes II&quot;.The film offers plenty of gore and violence,unfortunately it lacks foreboding atmosphere of dread,suspense,personality and realistic,sympathetic characters who were developed beyond average slasher movie fodder.There is a little bit of terror and quite nasty rape scene,but the characters are cardboard and one-dimensional.Still the film is much better than extremely horrible &quot;The Hills Have Eyes II&quot; made by Craven in 1985.My generous rating:7 out of 10.\n\nExcellent quality dvd rip.\n\nNOT IN ISO FORMAT!! You have to burn this or get a program that will play it from the hdd, such as this one \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrents.thepiratebay.se/3822341/CyberLink_PowerDVD_Ultra_v7.3.3104a_Unattended.3822341.TPB.torrent&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrents.thepiratebay.se/3822341/CyberLink_PowerDVD_Ultra_v7.3.3104a_Unattended.3822341.TPB.torrent&lt;/a&gt; from ADHDerby.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62160a3e99a477a80e31337b60a86fb0a5711328","amp;dn":"HILLS_HAVE_EYES_2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62160a3e99a477a80e31337b60a86fb0a5711328","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,22,10,62,153,164,119,168,14,49,51,123,96,168,111,176,165,113,19,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
