At first all he wants to do is rid himself of this curse, until a wacky psycologist (played to perfection by Bette Midler) shows him that this could be used to his advantage! His first target is Darcy McGuire, the very woman that got the promotion he wanted. But just as his plan is beginning to work, love gets in the way","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:922649d93d8be4e6e117041dc9a88f6dd23ac2a6","amp;dn":"What+Women+Want+%28En+que+piensan+las+muejeres%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"922649d93d8be4e6e117041dc9a88f6dd23ac2a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,38,73,217,61,139,228,230,225,23,4,29,201,168,143,109,210,58,194,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
