If you Don&amp;#039;t like the subtitles you can turn them off, sorry English isn&amp;#039;t my native language.\n\n# Jon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e329fb93ff731a99c8e824d28fb9ecc93d3f796d","amp;dn":"POWERTRIP_What_is_paintball_DVDR_ENGSUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e329fb93ff731a99c8e824d28fb9ecc93d3f796d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,41,251,147,255,115,26,153,200,232,36,210,143,185,236,201,61,63,121,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
