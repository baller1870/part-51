More information at http://meetthegimp.org\n\n\n\nToday I talk about resolutions in GIMP, not about the ones for the New Year. An insightful discussion about this is at the Tips from the Top Floor Forum. Wikipedia has this about DPI.\n\nIf your GIMP doesnÃƒÂ¢??t show the resolution part of the dialog, look for an ÃƒÂ¢??advancedÃƒÂ¢?? button. I saw it once, but canÃƒÂ¢??t recall where.\n\nIf you want to find out how I made the image for this show, get the download from the download page.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9ee4f68815e6407cfab197d90122fe6c108ae94","amp;dn":"Meet_the_Gimp_Videopodcast_Episode_026_Resolutions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9ee4f68815e6407cfab197d90122fe6c108ae94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,238,79,104,129,94,100,7,207,171,25,125,144,18,47,230,193,8,174,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
