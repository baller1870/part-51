She&amp;#039;s a brilliant lawyer with a sharp, strategic mind. She also has an ulcer and doesn&amp;#039;t get much sleep. It&amp;#039;s not the job that&amp;#039;s getting to her. It&amp;#039;s her millionaire boss, George Wade (Hugh Grant). Handsome, charming and undeniably self-absorbed, he treats her more like a nanny than a Harvard Law grad and can barely choose a tie without her help. Now, after one year of calling the shots-on everything from his clothes to his divorce settlements - Lucy Kelson is calling it quits.\n\nISO file ready for burning on 1 DVD (single layer), high quality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d677cea3494d7e68e1d3665691349c332e3e665","amp;dn":"Two+weeks+notice.ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d677cea3494d7e68e1d3665691349c332e3e665","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,103,124,234,52,148,215,230,142,29,54,101,105,19,73,195,50,227,230,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
