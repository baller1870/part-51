The synthetics are versatile and creative, drawing upon traditional synthesized sounds and exploring new noises with equal dedication.\n\nStrongly melodic in a dramatic way, the music fills the listener with expectant bliss, the promise of vaster horizons and unlimited possibilities. The tunes possess a charisma that is rooted in their playful harmonies. There is a profusion of epic crescendos lurking among these dynamic songs.\n\nA few tracks feature operatic female vocals (of a non-lyrical nature) which generate a classical flair for these indefatigable pieces.\n\nSnelders&amp;#039; music harks back to the early 80s, drawing some comparisons to Tangerine Dream&amp;#039;s style (circa &quot;Tangram&quot;), but he has infused an inordinate amount of grandeur to this sound, propelling the music far beyond the earthly stratosphere.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4c919e2f105d331fbd8706ced7ee6380ede6bfa","amp;dn":"Eric+Snelders+-+The+Source+of+Scarlet+Dreams+%5BE-Newage+1998%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4c919e2f105d331fbd8706ced7ee6380ede6bfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,201,25,226,241,5,211,49,251,216,112,108,237,126,230,56,14,222,107,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
