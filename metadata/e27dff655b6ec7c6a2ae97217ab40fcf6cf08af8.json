Same sort of topics etc. But I always end up feeling as if I have received more information from Kevin&amp;#039;s 2-hour show, than what I&amp;#039;m getting from Coast&amp;#039;s 4-hour show.\n\nIf you like Coast To Coast AM, chances are that you will like this show, as well.\n\nLearn more @ www.kevinsmithshow.com\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e27dff655b6ec7c6a2ae97217ab40fcf6cf08af8","amp;dn":"Kevin+Smith+Show+%5B09.13.07%5D+John+Hogue.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e27dff655b6ec7c6a2ae97217ab40fcf6cf08af8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,125,255,101,91,110,199,198,162,174,151,33,122,180,15,207,108,240,138,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
