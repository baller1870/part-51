One day, the occupational therapist who was hypnotising him keels over dead, leaving him with a permanantly altered attitude. Asked to come in on weekends, he responds by coming in only when he wants to, playing games on his computer and moving furniture to give himself a better view. But instead of firing him, the company takes this oddness as evidence of his managerial potential. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLength:         01:29:16     \nSize:           700 MB \nResolution:     624x464\nFramerate:      23.976 NTSC\nData rate:      26kpbs\nAudio Bitrate:  110kpbs\nTotal bitrate:  137kpbs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6c2a9f6c8b13e26068352f09a88060ee4fe644c","amp;dn":"office.space.dvdrip.mp3.1999.eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6c2a9f6c8b13e26068352f09a88060ee4fe644c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,194,169,246,200,177,62,38,6,131,82,240,154,136,6,14,228,254,100,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
