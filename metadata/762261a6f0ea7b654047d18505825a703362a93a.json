Craig Winn uses the context of the Hadith to illuminate the Quran, the incredible messy nature of the &amp;#039;divine&amp;#039; revelations Muhammed supposedly received from Allah. \n\nIt proceeds into showing how the scriptures motivate the Mujahedeen, the Jihad movement and modern-day terrorists, as well as the dhimmi system and the general spirit of submission that permeates Islam. \n\nWhile the book deals with scripture and serious issue, the dry humour of the author makes this hilarious reading. Unless you&amp;#039;re an imam, in which case you&amp;#039;ll probably detonate with fury for having your knowledge revealed.\n\nThis is a long (50+ hours of audio) book, downloaded from the web site of the author (http://www.prophetofdoom.net). The original audio files have been cut into pieces more suitable for iPod and other musick players.\n\nThe book is out of print, and the author makes this audio version as well as the the original pdf freely downloadable from his web site. Please distribute widely.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:762261a6f0ea7b654047d18505825a703362a93a","amp;dn":"PoD+Audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"762261a6f0ea7b654047d18505825a703362a93a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,34,97,166,240,234,123,101,64,71,209,133,5,130,90,112,51,98,169,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
