Since the tastes of the musicians don&amp;#039;t belong to the same genre their arrangements are mixtures of such traditions as alternative, indie, solid rock, folk tradition and even renaissance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d26e25f3f9881e0b5e5bcc6a515d2b892dd6821","amp;dn":"White+Owl+-+Pepper+%28folk-core%29+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d26e25f3f9881e0b5e5bcc6a515d2b892dd6821","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,38,226,95,63,152,129,224,181,229,188,198,165,21,210,184,146,221,104,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
