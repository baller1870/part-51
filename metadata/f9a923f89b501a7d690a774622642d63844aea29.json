Same sort of topics etc. But I always end up feeling as if I have received more information from Kevin&amp;#039;s 2-hour show, than what I&amp;#039;m getting from Coast&amp;#039;s 4-hour show.\n\nIf you like Coast To Coast AM, chances are that you will like this show, as well.\n\nLearn more @ www.kevinsmithshow.com\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9a923f89b501a7d690a774622642d63844aea29","amp;dn":"Kevin+Smith+Show+%5B08.30.07%5D+-+Mining+the+Moon.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9a923f89b501a7d690a774622642d63844aea29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,169,35,248,155,80,26,125,105,10,119,70,34,100,45,99,132,74,234,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
