Once you become accustomed to it you&amp;#039;ll find yourself quickly missing not having SpeedyStart on a machine without it. \n\n\nFull user configurability \n\n\nAccessing frequently used items has never been quicker. \n\n\nWorks with Windows XP &amp; Vista \n\n\nSpeedyStart requires no additional processes running in order to work. \n\nMore info here  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://S2k-Avenger.forever.as&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://S2k-Avenger.forever.as&lt;/a&gt; \n\nSorry guys!
