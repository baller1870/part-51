She is a young Seattle college dropout who is unhappy with life. She is always at odds with her mom, Joy. One day coming back from her temp job as a filing clerk, she is hit by the toliet seat of the re-entering Space Station Mir. Finding out she is now dead, she is recruited to become a grim reaper. As in life, she is a pain in the butt in death. She does not like the details of her job, and is always at loggerheads with her boss Rube. Her fellow grim reapers don&amp;#039;t really take much of a liking to her either. She also learns grim reapers don&amp;#039;t even get a free ride in death, as they must hold down regular jobs along with their death duties.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nDescarga este torrent ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0db7c126ac6ff0c57920cea02b57af66b20f2eb","amp;dn":"Dead+Like+Me+S2+DVD4%2F4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0db7c126ac6ff0c57920cea02b57af66b20f2eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,219,124,18,106,198,255,12,87,146,12,234,2,181,122,246,107,32,242,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
