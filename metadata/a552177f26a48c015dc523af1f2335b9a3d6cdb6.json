Here is how Rod Serling &amp; company handled the same classic golden-age sci-fi story about 5 years later.  I&amp;#039;ve chosen to use the seldom seen original hour-long episode as broadcast in 1971 with three individual stories rather than the more commonly re-run half-hour episode of just The Little Black Bag, as the shorter re-run version cuts out about 5 minutes worth of the original story that is still all there in this version.  Consider the two additional stories a bonus.\n\nFirst torrent I&amp;#039;ve ever uploaded anywhere, so I hope it all works OK...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a552177f26a48c015dc523af1f2335b9a3d6cdb6","amp;dn":"Night+Gallery+-+The+Little+Black+Bag+%2B2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a552177f26a48c015dc523af1f2335b9a3d6cdb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,82,23,127,38,164,140,1,93,197,35,175,31,35,53,185,163,214,205,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
