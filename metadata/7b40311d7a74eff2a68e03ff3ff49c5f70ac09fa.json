According to Michael   \u0019\n \u0018 Tsarion&amp;#039;s astonishing thesis, some of these original &amp;#039;Fallen        \u0019\n \u0018 Angels&amp;#039; are secretly interred beneath the ground in Iraq,           \u0019\n \u0018 Afghanistan, and in other locations around the globe. These         \u0019\n \u0018 &amp;#039;undead&amp;#039; vampiristic kings of old have been feeding off the death   \u0019\n \u0018 and mayhem, the pain and fear of human beings for millennia and     \u0019\n \u0018 their servants, upon the earth&amp;#039;s surface, have orchestrated wars,   \u0019\n \u0018 assassinations, and a climate of perversity and debauchery to feed  \u0019\n \u0018 their dark masters soon to arise again from their unholy repose.    \u0019\n \u0018 This arising is forced due to the approach of powerful              \u0019\n \u0018 constellational alignments and the coming of an &amp;#039;Age of Revealing&amp;#039;  \u0019\n \u0018 referred to in ancient Maya texts, and in the Book of Revelations.  \u0019\n \u0018 It is of paramount importance that each and every human being       \u0019\n \u0018 discovers what these alignments will mean, what the future holds,   \u0019\n \u0018 and what the world&amp;#039;s ancient scriptures are warning us about. This  \u0019\n \u0018 riveting investigation into the occult history of the world will    \u0019\n \u0018 open your eyes and allow you to make sense of the agendas of        \u0019\n \u0018 government and religion, the strange preoccupations of the media,   \u0019\n \u0018 and much of what will transpire in future years.                    \u0019\n \u0018                                                                     \u0019\n \u0018 Additionally, Michael also reminds to us of the importance of       \u0019\n \u0018 cleansing the &amp;#039;inner temple.&amp;#039; He reminds us that a toxic mind       \u0019\n \u0018 creates a toxic society. It is schizoid people who inevitably       \u0019\n \u0018 create a schizogenic society, and who are responsible for           \u0019\n \u0018 raising-up the sadistic &amp;#039;Orwellian&amp;#039; regimes which prey over the     \u0019\n \u0018 good and the free. Michael delineates for us the age-old            \u0019\n \u0018 connections between mind and world, between microcosm and           \u0019\n \u0018 macrocosm, so that we are again empowered with proactive and        \u0019\n \u0018 sustainable solutions. Michael insists that we must re-learn how    \u0019\n \u0018 to put our own inner houses in order before our efforts at          \u0019\n \u0018 overcoming our inhuman adversaries can be successful. Other         \u0019\n \u0018 stratagems are merely akin to &amp;#039;re-arranging the furniture on the    \u0019\n \u0018 Titanic,&amp;#039; and have not been working. Therefore, it is time for      \u0019\n \u0018 humanity to show zero-tolerance for all the false paths and leads,  \u0019\n \u0018 and to have the truth about change. These are just a few of the     \u0019\n \u0018 topics covered in this monumental 13 hour presentation.\n\n\n  R I P   C O M M E N T S     ÃƒË†Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½ÃƒÅ Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½\u0010\n \u0018                                                                     \u0019\n \u0018  Although this is over 8 hours long, the quality for a 3 CD rip     \u0019\n \u0018  is good and should leave no one complaining (see sample).          \u0019\n \u0018                                                                     \u0019\n Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b40311d7a74eff2a68e03ff3ff49c5f70ac09fa","amp;dn":"2012+Where+History+Ends","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b40311d7a74eff2a68e03ff3ff49c5f70ac09fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,64,49,29,122,116,239,242,166,142,3,255,63,244,156,95,112,172,9,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
