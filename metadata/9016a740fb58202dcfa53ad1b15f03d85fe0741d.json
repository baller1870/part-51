It has tracks from \n    many already established well known artists and bands the like of Lamb,\n    Hybrid, BT, Evolution, The Future Sound Of London, to name a few. It\n    encompases many musical styles that tronik members enjoy so much that\n    they are completely engrossed in music. Something about ambient drum n \n    bass music that lends itself to a female lead vocal, serious progressive \n    house music that rocks many dancefloor, tunes that are served chilled,\n    a blissfully epic tune enriched with piano melodies, layers of\n    traditional percussions and electronic drum samples, emotionally \n    powerful deep house tune, and a moody tune that combines experimental \n    sound collages and groovy sound of electronica. All those combined makes \n    this experience a must for electronic music fans. This is a dynamic, \n    compelling electronic soundscape that you should never miss. It is very \n    easy to slide into a trance listening to all these music. Join us in the\n    uplifting dance and sense the beauty of diversity in this magic album. \n\n    Enjoy!\n\n    -Tronik-\n\n\n:???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????:\n\n    CD 1\n\n    *Track 01*\n\n    Anacoeic Void - Celestial Dream\n\n    Label: Save the Vinyl UK (STV UK1)\n    Source: Vinyl\n    Year: 1996\n    Ripped by: DJMaSSiV\n\n    Written and Produced by Martin Richardson\n    Co-Produced by Mark Lloyd\n    Recorded at Anacoeic Void Studios, Holborn\n\n    &quot;Swirling Atmospheric Trance.&quot;\n\n\n    *Track 02*\n\n    Bam Bam - Where&amp;#039;s Your Child\n\n    Label: Desire/Westbrook\n    Source: CD\n    Year: 1988\n    Ripped by: retro-tronik\n\n    Early acid house classic from Chris Westbrook. This track has recently\n    been re-released for 2001 with a remix from DJ Rush.\n\n\n    *Track 03*\n\n    BT - The Revolution Will Be Televised\n\n    Label: Elektra Records\n    Source: CD\n    Year: 2001\n    Ripped by: Accadia\n\n    Taken From Tomb Raider OST\n\n\n    *Track 04*\n\n    Chris &amp; James - Calm Down (King Size Mix 1)\n\n    King Size = Scott Marzullo &amp; Joe Ventura\n\n    Label: Stress Promo (12STRX51)\n    Source: Vinyl\n    Year: 1995\n    Ripped by: Bluefish\n\n    Xcellent progressive acid breaks, this tune also happens to be the best\n    mix of &quot;Calm Down.&quot; Omg!! This tune still sounds fresh today. Not only\n    that, it&amp;#039;s guaranteed to cause serious damage on the dancefloor.\n\n\n    *Track 05*\n\n    D:Ream - Things Can Only Get Better (Overworld Mix)\n\n    Label: Warner Music\n    Source: Vinyl\n    Year: 1993\n    Ripped by: Origin\n\n    Written by P.

It sounds \n    much like an edit to me. But, it&amp;#039;s not the 7&quot; edit. This kind of full \n    credentials artist could have made it better. If you are really curious \n    what this one sounds like, now is the best time to grab it.\n\n\n    *Track 08*\n\n    LunaSol - Dawn\n\n    Label: Hallucination Records\n    Source: CD\n    Year: 1994\n    Ripped by: Bluefish\n\n    An ambient project of RITM. It&amp;#039;s so emotionally powerful. Good stuff.\n\n\n    *Track 09*\n\n    Rhythmatic - Take Me Back (Bass Head Mix)\n\n    Label: Network\n    Source: CD\n    Year: 1990\n    Ripped by: retro-tronik\n\n    Early bleep classic from Gamble and Crawford. This was the eigth release\n    on the Network label. This track was inspired by Joshie Jo Armstead&amp;#039;s\n    I&amp;#039;ve Got The Vibes. Network records received several complaints of\n    speaker damage after the release of this track.\n\n\n    *Track 10*\n\n    Sander Kleinenberg - Hidden Agenda\n\n    Label: Combined Forces\n    Source: CD\n    Year: 2001\n    Ripped by: Accadia\n\n    Taken From Four Seasons EP 3.3 (Part 1)\n\n\n:???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????:\n\n    CD 2\n\n    *Track 01*\n\n    Aphex Twin - Alberto Balsalm\n\n    Label: Sire/Warp\n    Source: CD\n    Year: 1995\n    Ripped by: Null\n\n    Written and produced by Richard D. James\n\n    This is the first track I ever heard by Richard D. James, and I was\n    hooked.  Musical genius?  Twisted skitzo who lives in an abandoned\n    bank?  Probably both, but damn he does some nice ambient-esque stuff.\n    This track is a prime example. From the album &quot;...I Care Because You Do&quot;\n\n\n    *Track 02*\n\n    Chris &amp; James - Fox Force One\n\n    Label: Stress Promo (12STR51)\n    Source: Vinyl\n    Year: 1995\n    Ripped by: Bluefish\n\n    One of my all-time favorite tunes, &quot;Chris &amp; James&amp;#039; Fox Force One&quot; is the\n    mother of all epic house. Released on one of the most revered labels in \n    the history of progressive house, Stress Records, this tune was one to \n    prove that Stress was a serious player and vanguard of club culture. \n    For anyone who has heard &quot;Fox Force Five,&quot; this tune is just an \n    instrumental version of it.\n\n\n    *Track 03*\n\n    Gintare - Guilty (Francois K Remix)\n\n    Label: Sony\n    Source: Vinyl\n    Year: 2000\n    Ripped by: Solace\n\n    A fucking EXCELLENTTTTTTTT tune!!!!!

Cascades. Not sure there is anything I need to say about this\n    track. I&amp;#039;ve included the &amp;#039;Shortform&amp;#039; mix here to leave space for all the\n    other excellent tracks my colleages have put forth. Definitely is and\n    will always be in my top ten.\n\n\n    *Track 08*\n\n    The Future Sound Of London - My Kingdom (Part 4)\n\n    Label: Astralwerks\n    Source: CD\n    Year: 1996\n    Ripped by: Moonface\n\n    A slightly faster paced version than any of the other Paths...\n    It is included on the CD singles, however this is a rarer, unmixed \n    version.\n\n\n    *Track 09*\n\n    Zenith Nadir - Synfinity (Lime House Outlaw Mix)\n\n    Label: White Label\n    Source: Vinyl\n    Year: Unknown\n    Ripped by: Bluefish\n\n    Lime House Outlaw aka The Wolfgang Press\n\n    Their first release &quot;My Odyssey&quot; EP on Vinyl Republic (1500 limited\n    press) went on John Digweed&amp;#039;s Renaissance 2 CD (over 500,000). With over\n    ten years producing music in different arena&amp;#039;s, this group is on the\n    move. &quot;Synfinity&quot; is another classic this group has brought to the\n    underground scene.\n\n\n:???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????:\n\n    CD 3\n\n    *Track 01*\n\n    Beat Foundation - My Freedom\n\n    Label: Skinny Malinky\n    Source: CD\n    Year: Unknown\n    Ripped by: Bluefish\n\n    Produced &amp; arranged by Beat Foundation. Published by Malinky Music\n\n    Excellent ambient tune from Skinny Malinky&amp;#039;s most respected artist.\n    This was probably unreleased. One of their best works.\n\n\n    *Track 02*\n\n    BT - Quark (Evolution&amp;#039;s Coolaid Mix)\n\n    Label: Kinetic/Reprise/Perfecto Promo\n    Source: Vinyl\n    Year: 1996\n    Ripped by: Bluefish\n\n    I don&amp;#039;t know why such a beautiful tune as this one never got an\n    official release. Fade Mix is also very cool. But, this one pull a \n    stop to all mixes. For those of you who haven&amp;#039;t got this tune, this\n    is your chance.\n\n\n    *Track 03*\n\n    Evolution - Dub Communication\n\n    Written &amp; produced by Barry Jamieson &amp; Jonothon Sutton.\n\n    Label: Deconstruction Promo\n    Source: Vinyl\n    Year: 1993\n    Ripped by: Bluefish\n\n    This tune is one of the earliest Manchester&amp;#039;s wonderboys productions \n    that that never got released officially. It&amp;#039;s a remarkably well produced \n    chilled experimental track that incorporate some interesting elements. \n    This tune also proves that Evolution is not just a master of progressive \n    house. Having been producing for more than ten years and since Sasha&amp;#039;s \n    very first remix with them, Evolution is always ready to take dance \n    culture by storm. This tune illustrates the creativity that can be \n    cracked out of their heads.\n\n\n    *Track 04*\n\n    Lamb - Cotton Wool (Hidden Album Mix)\n\n    Label: Mercury Records\n    Source: CD\n    Year: 1996\n    Ripped by: ILM\n\n    Not content with melting our ears with the gorgeous &amp;#039;Gorecki&amp;#039;, the Lamb\n    duo prove yet again that they have the perfect formula to reduce grown\n    men and women to tears. Stunning breaks coupled with an ultra moody\n    heart-wrenching vocal. Stunning!\n\n\n    *Track 05*\n\n    Legion of Green Men - Synaptic Response (Faculties of Cognition)\n\n    Label: Plus8 Records (PLUS8045CD)\n    Source: CD\n    Year: 1994\n    Ripped by: Null\n\n    Written by Alexander Addicus &amp; Rupert J. Lloyd\n\n    The video for this track used to get a lot of play on AMP in the\n    mid-90&amp;#039;s.  That was back when MTV didn&amp;#039;t completely suck, and actually\n    played decent music late sunday nights.  I had to do some searching\n    to find this cd back then, and would probably be hard pressed to find\n    it at all today. From the album &quot;Spatial Specific&quot;\n\n\n    *Track 06*\n\n    Saint Etienne - Pale Movie (Secret Knowledge Trouser Assassin Mix)\n\n    Label: Heavenly\n    Source: CD\n    Year: 1994\n    Ripped by: Urban Angel\n\n    Even before I seriously got into progressive house/trance/epic (whatever\n    you want to label it!) I&amp;#039;ve been a big fan of St Etienne. Sarah\n    Cracknell&amp;#039;s vocals are just so sublime, perfectly dancing over the retro\n    rhythms put together by fellow members Stanley &amp; Wiggs. I was introduced\n    to this mix by the 2CD compilation Casino Classics and instantly started\n    tracking down old releases hoping I could find more of these excellent\n    remixes. A classic IMHO, always around and about when I&amp;#039;ll looking for\n    something with a beat. They even manage to slip in a sneaky vocal clip\n    from Crossroads!\n\n\n    *Track 07*\n\n    Strange Brew - Burnin&amp;#039; Down (Ghost Town Dub)\n\n    Label: Robsrecords\n    Source: Vinyl\n    Year: 1994\n    Ripped by: Origin\n\n    Written &amp; arranged by Jake Purdy &amp; Martin Fisher.

Subtle downtempo\n    breaks intertwined with some clever drum-n-bass textures all topped off\n    with a stunning vocal and haunting saxophone. Grab a chilled drink, kick\n    back and relax ...\n\n\n:???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????:\n\n    It&amp;#039;s all about quality music. That matters.
