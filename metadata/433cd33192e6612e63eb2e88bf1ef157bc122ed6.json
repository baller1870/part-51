I have incorporated a function called linking which is only available in the .MKV container into these files. So when both parts are played from the same directory they will play as one. If you select the second part to watch the movie will play from the beginning. The time code is also seamless between the two segments. The second part doesn&amp;#039;t begin at 0 with a new time code. Watching these two parts should be one seamless stream to the observer. This is why I have chosen to make this movie a .MKV instead of .mp4 as I usually do. So with this copy there is no need to have your HD movie watching experience interrupted at some arbitrary point because you need to load the second part.\n\n\n\nA long time ago, far away on the planet of Cybertron, a war was being waged between the noble Autobots (led by the wise Optimus Prime) and the devious Decepticons (commanded by the dreaded Megatron) for control over the Allspark, a mystical talisman that would grant unlimited power to whoever possessed it. The Autobots managed to smuggle the Allspark off the planet, but Megatron blasted off in search of it. He eventually tracked it to the planet of Earth (circa 1850), but his reckless desire for power sent him right into the Arctic Ocean, and the sheer cold forced him into a paralyzed state. His body was later found by Captain Archibald Witwicky, and before going into a comatose state Megatron used the last of his energy to engrave a map, showing the location of the Allspark, into the Captain&amp;#039;s glasses, and send a transmission to Cybertron. He is then carted away by the Captain&amp;#039;s ship. A century later, Sam Witwicky, nicknamed Spike by his friends, buys his first car. To his shock, he discovers it to be Bumblebee, an Autobot in disguise who is to protect Spike, as he bears the Captain&amp;#039;s glasses and the map carved on them. But Bumblebee is not the only Transformer to have arrived on Earth - in the desert of Qatar, the Decepticons Blackout and Scorponok attack a U.S. military base, causing the Pentagon to send their special Sector Seven agents to capture all &quot;specimens of this alien race,&quot; and Spike and his girlfriend Mikaela find themselves in the middle of a grand battle between the Autobots and the Decepticons, stretching from Hoover Dam all the way to Los Angeles. Meanwhile, within the depths of Hoover Dam, the cryogenically stored form of Megatron awakens...\n\n\n\nIMDB link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418279/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418279/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDon&amp;#039;t forget to visit us at www.sharego.net!\n\nTotal File Size = 6.8 GB\n\nAVInaptic Report Part 1:\n\n[ About file ]\n\nName: Transformers Part 1.mkv\nDate: 30/10/2007 16:53:17\nSize: 4,617,414,972 bytes (4403.51 MB)\n\n[ Generic info ]\n\nPlay duration: 01:29:56 (5395.865 s)\nContainer type: matroska\nCreation time: 30/10/2007 20:46:01 UTC\nNumber of streams: 9\nType of stream nr. 1: video (V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC)\nType of stream nr. 2: audio (A_AC3) {Main}\nType of stream nr. 3: audio (A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)) {French}\nType of stream nr. 4: audio (A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)) {Spanish}\nType of stream nr. 5: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nType of stream nr. 6: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nType of stream nr. 7: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nType of stream nr. 8: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nType of stream nr. 9: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nAudio streams: 3\nMuxing Application: libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\nWriting Application: mkvmerge v2.1.0 (&amp;#039;Another Place To Fall&amp;#039;) built on Aug 19 2007 13:40:07\n\n[ Relevant data ]\n\nResolution: 1280 x 544\nWidth: multiple of 32\nHeight: multiple of 32\n\n[ Video track ]\n\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nResolution: 1280 x 544 (*)\nFrame aspect ratio: 40:17 = 2.352941 (~2.35:1)\nPixel aspect ratio: 544:545 = 0.998165\nDisplay aspect ratio: 256:109 = 2.348623 (~2.35:1)\nFramerate: 23.975985 fps\n\n[ Audio track nr. 1 ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AC3\nChannels: 6\nSample rate: 48000 Hz\n\n[ Audio track nr. 2 ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)\nChannels: 6\nSample rate: 24000 Hz\nOutput sample rate: 48000 Hz\n\n[ Audio track nr. 3 ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)\nChannels: 6\nSample rate: 24000 Hz\nOutput sample rate: 48000 Hz \n\n\nAVInaptic Report Part 2:\n\n\n[ About file ]\n\nName: Transformers Part 2.mkv\nDate: 30/10/2007 16:56:31\nSize: 2,681,552,393 bytes (2557.328 MB)\n\n[ Generic info ]\n\nPlay duration: 00:53:58 (3238.199 s)\nContainer type: matroska\nCreation time: 30/10/2007 20:53:17 UTC\nNumber of streams: 9\nType of stream nr. 1: video (V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC)\nType of stream nr. 2: audio (A_AC3) {Main}\nType of stream nr. 3: audio (A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)) {French}\nType of stream nr. 4: audio (A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)) {Spanish}\nType of stream nr. 5: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nType of stream nr. 6: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nType of stream nr. 7: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nType of stream nr. 8: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nType of stream nr. 9: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nAudio streams: 3\nMuxing Application: libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\nWriting Application: mkvmerge v2.1.0 (&amp;#039;Another Place To Fall&amp;#039;) built on Aug 19 2007 13:40:07\n\n[ Relevant data ]\n\nResolution: 1280 x 544\nWidth: multiple of 32\nHeight: multiple of 32\n\n[ Video track ]\n\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nResolution: 1280 x 544 (*)\nFrame aspect ratio: 40:17 = 2.352941 (~2.35:1)\nPixel aspect ratio: 544:545 = 0.998165\nDisplay aspect ratio: 256:109 = 2.348623 (~2.35:1)\nFramerate: 23.975985 fps\n\n[ Audio track nr. 1 ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AC3\nChannels: 6\nSample rate: 48000 Hz\n\n[ Audio track nr. 2 ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)\nChannels: 6\nSample rate: 24000 Hz\nOutput sample rate: 48000 Hz\n\n[ Audio track nr. 3 ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)\nChannels: 6\nSample rate: 24000 Hz\nOutput sample rate: 48000 Hz\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:433cd33192e6612e63eb2e88bf1ef157bc122ed6","amp;dn":"Transformers+HD+720p+SeCtIoN8+%7BSharegoRG%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"433cd33192e6612e63eb2e88bf1ef157bc122ed6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,60,211,49,146,230,97,46,99,235,46,136,191,30,241,87,188,18,46,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
