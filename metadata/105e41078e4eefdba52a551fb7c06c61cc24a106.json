I plan to edit them and make a separate torrent for 1024X768 wallpapers soon.\n\nI&amp;#039;m making the images in sets, each set having roughly 3-5 images. The sets generally correspond to where I took the original photos, what the photos were of, and my general feeling towards to finished work.\n\nThis is my first set, called Intimacy. I&amp;#039;ll be uploading 2 more sets straight after this so watch out for them.\n\nHere are the thumbnails for the wallpapers:\n\n[img]http://random.decyph.com/thumbs/wallpaper_series/01intimacy.jpg[/img]\n\nPlease feel free to do what you like with them. I don&amp;#039;t mind you using them for commercial purposes. But I would appreciate you giving me (Athanatis) credit for these wallpapers for any non-personal use. It would also be great if you could tell me what you&amp;#039;re using them for, and give me the website if there is one (this is more for personal pride really, so that I know people like my work).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:105e41078e4eefdba52a551fb7c06c61cc24a106","amp;dn":"Original+abstract+art+-+WIDESCREEN+hi-res+wallpapers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"105e41078e4eefdba52a551fb7c06c61cc24a106","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,94,65,7,142,78,239,219,165,42,85,31,183,192,108,97,204,36,161,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
