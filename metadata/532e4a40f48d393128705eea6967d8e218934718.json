They do a poppier version of the Euro-garage thing (Hives, Manikins, Caesars), with a heavy infusion of mod/R &amp; B and kind of a Brit-pop feel to the vocals. Perhaps that doesn\\&amp;#039;t sound revolutionary on paper, but on record it\\&amp;#039;s a blast! From wire to wire, this platter is catchier than the clap and more hyper than a nine-year-old on a Red Bull bender. The Alien Snatch press release says it all: \\&quot;With the loud guitars, the adrenalized and totally on the spot vocals, and a firecracker backbeat, this pop record will make you bounce your cheap flat walls off!!\\&quot; Right on, brother! Listening to any of these songs, I\\&amp;#039;m reminded of those TV commercials where they show people listening to their MP3 players and dancing around like crazy and having a good time. \\&quot;Come On, Come On\\&quot; may be Song of the Year for 2006, and \\&quot;One With Us\\&quot; may be #2. And I can\\&amp;#039;t get over how fucking good the vinyl sounds - so warm and crisp and just freakin\\&amp;#039; PERFECT. Records like this one may convert me back into a vinyl purist!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:532e4a40f48d393128705eea6967d8e218934718","amp;dn":"The+Ackermans-No+One+Knows+Us+Better+Than+The+Ackermans+%282004%29+i","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"532e4a40f48d393128705eea6967d8e218934718","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,46,74,64,244,141,57,49,40,112,94,234,105,103,216,226,24,147,71,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
