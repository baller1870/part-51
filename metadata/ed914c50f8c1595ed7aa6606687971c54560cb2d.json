John Dyson has gathered together various unreleased Wavestar pieces, some of which were destined for the follow-up to &amp;#039;Moonwind&amp;#039;, and released them on what is effectively a Wavestar retrospective. As John says himself in the sleevenotes &quot;...I think I&amp;#039;ve forgotten most of the reasons why they were left to moulder. Therefore there is no reason why you shouldn&amp;#039;t hear them.&quot; The journey begins with &amp;#039;Messiah&amp;#039;, recorded in early &amp;#039;88 and was perhaps destined to be the opener of the new album. It certainly has that &quot;setting out&quot; feeling and the 2:18 length suggest it may have been spliced with something else. &amp;#039;Early Voyages&amp;#039; is an early version of &amp;#039;Voyager&amp;#039; from the &amp;#039;Moonwind&amp;#039; album. Same feel and atmosphere though the sequencing is only suggested, this being largely a sketch of the opening section. &amp;#039;Early Rain&amp;#039; will be familiar to owners of &amp;#039;Different Values&amp;#039; as the track &amp;#039;Through the Rain&amp;#039; was based on this. John himself admits he prefers this version because of the sequencing and I agree. &amp;#039;Doom&amp;#039; is dominated by dark percussives and by Wavestar&amp;#039;s standards is a weird interlude. &amp;#039;Sea&amp;#039; really was an adhoc number, quickly conceived and never revisited but sounding fresh and somehow newborn. Two different versions of &amp;#039;Acrotramp&amp;#039; feature on the album, and with the first its your chance to add the lead-line. After reworking the piece with the TR707 drum machine they never got round to re-laying the theme, so it&amp;#039;s Wavestar Karaoke time! Up to now the album has been largely as advertised, a collection of interesting sketches and early versions. However, with the next 2 tracks things start to get seriously interesting. &amp;#039;Cleopatra&amp;#039;s Barge&amp;#039; opens with classic Wavestar sequencing, constantly ebbing and flowing, supplemented by string synth refrains. It&amp;#039;s a mesmeric piece which should have fans smiling with nostalgic pleasure. However, once they&amp;#039;ve heard &amp;#039;Crystal Ashes&amp;#039; they should be jumping for joy. Described by John as &amp;#039;...the one track we did finish for the proposed album&amp;#039; this piece underlines what a masterpiece that was destined to be. Chunky analog sequencing, beautiful chord changes and succulent themes combine to perfection. Apparently it was aired at the &amp;#039;86 Electronica and though John confesses to having made a complete &quot;balls-up&quot; of it he&amp;#039;s delighted to present it here as it should have sounded! &amp;#039;Theme&amp;#039; is a bright optimistic affair to match the athletics festival it was written for. Superficially it can sound lightweight but the sequencing especially must have taken some time to put together. &amp;#039;Turkish Bizarre&amp;#039; is a suitably atmospheric piece laden with eastern promise. A delightful reedy synth theme is backed by complex percussive sequencing. &amp;#039;Acrotramp 86&amp;#039; is actually a very different piece to the original and is in no way inferior. It&amp;#039;s another beautifully crafted outing with pulsing rhythms and a whimsical lead. A remix of &amp;#039;Messiah&amp;#039; ends the album - &quot;more in time than out of time&quot; are John&amp;#039;s concluding comments, hinting at the double edged origins of the album title. John as ever is doing himself an injustice. There&amp;#039;s plenty to please on this album with &amp;#039;Crystal Ashes&amp;#039; alone destined to become an all time New Age classic alongside &amp;#039;Time Node&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Voyager&amp;#039;.\n--------------------------------------------------------\nAn almost invaluable release by the historic New Age EM British duo John Dyson &amp; David Ward Hunt containing a masterful blend of atmospheric and comic oriented music from days gone by. Great post CD-production &amp; mastering done by Ron Boots. The bestseller-CD from Klemdag 1997!\nThe music is from the &quot;Moonwind&quot; period and all music is previously unreleased.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed914c50f8c1595ed7aa6606687971c54560cb2d","amp;dn":"Wavestar+-+Out+Of+Time+%28New+Age+1997+-+lossless%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed914c50f8c1595ed7aa6606687971c54560cb2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,145,76,80,248,193,89,94,215,170,102,6,104,121,113,197,69,96,203,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
