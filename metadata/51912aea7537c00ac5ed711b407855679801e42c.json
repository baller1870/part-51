This is largely considered his 20th album release, but more of a specialty album than his latest efforts\n\nThe album was released on May 31 by Jas Obrecht, through his label Avabella, who also released the Young Buckethead DVDs.\n\nAccording to Jas Obrecht:\n&quot;Imagine, if you will, that Buckethead walked into a quiet living room, picked up an acoustic guitar, and began improvising one amazing composition after the next -- that&amp;#039;s what happened when we recorded &quot;Acoustic Shards&quot; back in 1991. (It was taped a couple of weeks after the final Deli Creeps concert on the Young Buckethead DVDs, but is quite different musically.) It is a single-CD, 52:30 minutes in length, 15 tracks. Included are very early versions of &quot;For Mom&quot; and &quot;Who Me?&quot; as well as a lot of stuff you&amp;#039;ve never heard before. The playing is spectacular -- some of it sounds like Django Reinhardt meets Ornette Coleman meets young EVH meets... well, that which is uniquely and lovably Buckethead. Some passages are so advanced you&amp;#039;d swear it&amp;#039;s two guitarists -- but it was all recorded in real time and without overdubs -- while other parts are just melodically beautiful beyond words. So far, everyone who&amp;#039;s heard it has said it&amp;#039;s the kind of music that resonates in you long after the stereo&amp;#039;s been turned off.&quot;\n--Wikipedia.org\n\nTrack Listing:\n   1.
