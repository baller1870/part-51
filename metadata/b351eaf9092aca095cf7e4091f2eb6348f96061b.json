Sent to a mental institution, Michael spends the next 15 years just sitting, still staring into space despite the best efforts of his Doctor, Dr. Samuel Loomis. Now, on October 30th 1978, something triggers Michael off and during a storm manages to steal a car from Dr. Loomis and Nurse Marion (who was coming to take Michael to a court to keep him locked up) and goes back to Haddonfield where he steals a white mask. There, Laurie Stode, Micheal&amp;#039;s younger sister, finds that Michael is stalking her during the day (at school, at her home etc - but she doesn&amp;#039;t know who he is.) As Dr. Loomis arrives and with the Sheriff frantically looks for Michael he doesn&amp;#039;t know that Laurie is baby-sitting Lindsey and Tommy and that Laurie&amp;#039;s friends Annie, Lynda and Bob are disappearing one by one...\n\nCast(Cast overview, first billed only)\n\n\tDonald Pleasence\t... \tDr. Sam Loomis\n\n\tJamie Lee Curtis\t... \tLaurie Strode\n\tNancy Kyes\t... \tAnnie Brackett (as Nancy Loomis)\n\n\tP.J.
