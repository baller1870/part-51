I will update as needed (send me a PM if I miss it) \nenjoy. Alright for anyone paying attention you will see a ton of empty folders I \ncouldn&amp;#039;t figure out a way to quickly and cleanly clear those out. They are empty \nso they aren&amp;#039;t taking up any space. And if you look all the files are named \n&quot;wallpaper.jpg&quot; so don&amp;#039;t even consider moving them into the same folder. They \nsync just fine if you put them in the proper photo sync folder for iTunes. Once \nagain enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b7db791d9ebda5adb8c2a05e7edd7db1c5a6410","amp;dn":"Iconfactory+%28Complete+%5B05.Oct.07%5D+Iconfactory+Wallpapers+for+you","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b7db791d9ebda5adb8c2a05e7edd7db1c5a6410","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,125,183,145,217,235,218,90,219,140,42,5,231,237,215,219,28,90,100,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
