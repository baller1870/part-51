The first time,\nit was changed from &quot;Curtis&quot; to &quot;Curtis S.S.K.&quot;.\nThe &quot;S.S.K.&quot;, which stood for &quot;SoundScan Killer&quot;,\nwas intended to show the pressure 50 Cent feels to\nsucceed. The second time, it was changed back to\n&quot;Curtis&quot;.\n\nIn July 2007, Kanye West changed the release date\nof Graduation, his third album, from September 18, 2007,\nto the same release date as Curtis, September 11, 2007.\nThis means that the albums will go head-to-head and\ncompete for better sales against each other. 50 Cent\nclaimed that if Graduation sold more records than\nCurtis, he would stop releasing solo albums.\nHowever, he later dispelled his comments.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e11e265cf400f5d1b4d99dc12d5017f0e1f4f672","amp;dn":"50_cent-curtis-%28explicit%29-2007-saw","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e11e265cf400f5d1b4d99dc12d5017f0e1f4f672","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,30,38,92,244,0,245,209,180,217,157,193,45,80,23,240,225,244,246,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
