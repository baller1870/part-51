Rating: \t\n  4.3 / 5 (based on 10 ratings).\n\nPlot:\tFu Sheng plays Fong Sai-yuk. Some guys train to beat a murderous master, but they don&amp;#039;t train enough and are killed half-way through the film, leaving the battle to men like Fu Sheng.\n\nOverview:\tThe evil Manchu clan is determined to rid China of all kung fu rivals--only the ancient Shaolin school remains defiant. Their finest warriors murdered by two of the Manchu&amp;#039;s ruthless hired assassins, the Shaolin turn in desperation to old masters in order to learn the ultimate secret martial arts disciplines--the only styles and tactics which might defeat their monstrous enemy. After months of agonizing training, the deadly Tiger and Crane combat styles are matched against the Manchu&amp;#039;s lethal Steel Skin technique in a bloody battle to the death.\n\nCast: \tAlexander Fu Sheng  ||  Chan Yi Ling  ||  Gordon Liu (Chia Hui)  ||  Johnny Wang (Lung Wei)  ||  Chi Kuan Chun  ||  Leung Kar Yan  ||  Simon Yuen (Siu Tin)  ||  Lo Dik  ||  Kong Do  ||  Fung Hak On  ||  Lau Kar Wing  ||  Tino Wong Cheung  ||  Jamie Luk (Kim Ming)  ||  Geung Nam \n\n_________________\nDo not break the share chain!
