Beginning with its conquest of the northern states, the film covers the history of this state where racial enslavement became triumphant and the nation carried sinister designs of conquest. Interspersed throughout are various TV commercials of products of a virulent racist nature as well as public service announcements promoting this tyranny. Only at the end do you learn that there is less wholly imagined material in the film than you might suspect. \n\nalliance Release.\n\nEnjoi\n\nThisOneGuy\n\nTeam CMS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45afcbb7395e0e7654264a1f31a5d451aa2917e0","amp;dn":"The.Confederate.States.Of.America.LiMiTED.DVDRip.XviD-ALLiANCE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45afcbb7395e0e7654264a1f31a5d451aa2917e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,175,203,183,57,94,14,118,84,38,74,31,49,165,212,81,170,41,23,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
