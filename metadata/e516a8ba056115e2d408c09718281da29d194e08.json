Gradually, through topics brought up and replied to, feelings of dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©jÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  vu, and props, it becomes seemingly obvious that he&amp;#039;s a German submarine officer. After unsuccessfully trying to convince the crew that they are in dangerÃƒÂ¢??he frantically tries to tell the crew and passengers that they are under attack, but to no avail, it is agony for himÃƒÂ¢?? the boat is sunk by a German U-boat commanded by Captain Lieutenant Lanser. He appears on the German ship with his second in command who asks him if he thinks they are being judged. He replies that the British may judge them. The first mate questions him on whether God is judging them. Then it all repeats, showing that he&amp;#039;s been condemned to sail, be sunk, and drown on the ghost of that ship forever. The episode is Carl Lanser&amp;#039;s hell.\n\nMP4 Format for your IPOD\n\nPLEASE SEED! \n\nEnjoy! \n\nAntil0ck, \n\n_______       ______________________      ______  \n___    |________  /___(_)__  /_  __ \\________  /__\n__  /| |_  __ \\  __/_  /__  /_  / / /  ___/_  //_/\n_  ___ |  / / / /_ _  / _  / / /_/ // /__ _  ,&lt;   \n/_/  |_/_/ /_/\\__/ /_/  /_/  \\____/ \\___/ /_/|_| ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e516a8ba056115e2d408c09718281da29d194e08","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+Episode+10-+Judgement+Night","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e516a8ba056115e2d408c09718281da29d194e08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,22,168,186,5,97,21,226,212,8,192,151,24,40,29,162,157,25,78,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
