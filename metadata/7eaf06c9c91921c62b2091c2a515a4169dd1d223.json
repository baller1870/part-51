The difference can not be heard. When he plays live, he uses (lots) of hardware synths though. This of course also makes a more interesting show. \n?From Earth To Mars? is an oasis of sequences, fat analogue synth solos and pads, effects, space-atmospheres and gentle electronic rhythms that -in case of sound- has references to the big New Age synth-names. Especially old Neuronium and Robert Schroeder come in mind. Sequences play an important part in Steve?s music. It immediately starts with a wonderful pattern in ?Light Bank?. This is continued in excellent epic tracks like ?Earth To Mars? and ?Solar Flare?. The music is long-stretched with a lot of emphasis on details. ?Goodbye? is a tribute to Michael Garrison, the New Age space music pioneer who sadly died a short while ago. This track shows another side of Steve with more warmth and melody. It reflects the many creative sides of Create. \nWith or without ?real? synthesizers; it doesn&amp;#039;t matter. Create makes good music and that is what counts! \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7eaf06c9c91921c62b2091c2a515a4169dd1d223","amp;dn":"Create+-+From+Earth+To+Mars+%28New+Age+2005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7eaf06c9c91921c62b2091c2a515a4169dd1d223","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,175,6,201,201,25,33,198,43,32,145,194,165,21,164,22,157,209,210,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
