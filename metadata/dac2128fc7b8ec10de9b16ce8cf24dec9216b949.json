Suffice it to say this is not a movie to watch if you&amp;#039;re offended by incest, rape, racial epithets and some nice scenes of humiliation thrown in for good measure. Here is the cast: A man wearing a ski mask who possesses a big machete + mother, brother, sister, hairy girl friend of sister -- all of whom just want to take an innocent trip into the forest . . . but Mr. Ski Mask has other ideas. Oh yes, and there&amp;#039;s a black man tied to a tree as well. The sister runs into him while trying to escape from Mr. Ski Mask. But Mr. Ski Mask With The Big Machete catches up. Uh-oh. Somehow I doubt VCX will be re-releasing this anytime soon, esp. with the PSYCHO theme played in its entirety. A peachy movie to watch with a group of people you really hate. \n\n\nlater/FFF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dac2128fc7b8ec10de9b16ce8cf24dec9216b949","amp;dn":"++Wet+Wilderness+%281974%29.............FFF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dac2128fc7b8ec10de9b16ce8cf24dec9216b949","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,194,18,143,199,184,236,16,222,155,22,206,140,242,77,236,146,22,185,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
