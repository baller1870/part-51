He is the US Ambassador to Italy and they want for nothing in their lives, except one thing: they do not have children. When Katharine has a stillborn child, Robert is approached by a priest at the hospital who suggest that he take a healthy newborn whose mother has just died in childbirth. Without telling his wife he agrees to to so but after relocating to London, strange events - and the ominous warnings of a priest - lead him to believe that the child he took from that Italian hospital is evil incarnate.\n\nvideo infromation:\nFile Name ..........: THE OMEN.Title1.DVDRip.avi\nTotal Size (Bytes) .: 737,900,544 Bytes\nTotal Size (KB) ....: 720,606 KB\nTotal Size (MB) ....: 703.72 MB\nTotal Streams ......: 2 Stream(s)\nFile Size Correct ..: Yes\n\nVideo Size (Bytes) .: 635,698,328 Bytes\nVideo Size (KB) ....: 620,799 KB\nVideo Size (MB) ....: 606.25 MB\nVideo Length .......: 01:46:27\nVideo Codec Code ...: DX50/divx\nVideo Codec Name ...: DivX 5.0 codec\nVideo Bitrate ......: 796 KB/s\nResolution .........: 640 x 256\nAspect Ratio .......: 2.50:1\nTotal Frames .......: 159677 Frames\nFramerate ..........: 25 FPS\nColor Depth ........: 24 Bits\nQuality Factor .....: 0.194 B/px\nPacked Bitstream ...: Yes\n\nAudio Size (Bytes) .: 102,192,000 Bytes\nAudio Size (KB) ....: 99,797 KB\nAudio Size (MB) ....: 97.46 MB\nAudio Length .......: 01:46:27\nAudio Codec Code ...: 85 (0x0055)\nAudio Codec Name ...: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3)\nAudio Bitrate ......: 128 KB/s (CBR)\nChannels ...........: 2 Ch\nSampling Rate ......: 48000 Hz\nsubtitles ..........: czech, dansk, english, Finish, Hebrew, Hungarian, Islenska, Norsk, Polish, Portugues, Svenska,.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a373a2fd42fac7249c243776d320c9498c836009","amp;dn":"The+Omen+%281976%29+with+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a373a2fd42fac7249c243776d320c9498c836009","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,115,162,253,66,250,199,36,156,36,55,118,211,32,201,73,140,131,96,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
