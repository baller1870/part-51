Nonetheless, their presence, and what little action there is, make the movie enjoyable.\n\nAvg. Rating: \t\n  4.3 / 5 (based on 8 ratings).\n\nPlot:\tDirector Lau Kar Leung&amp;#039;s trademark emphasis on martial virtue is very evident in his kung fu comedy &quot;My Young Auntie&quot;, which stars Kara Hui Ying Hung as a young heiress to an esteemed kung fu family embroiled in internal strife.\n\nOverview:\tSuccessful director Lau Kar Leung&amp;#039;s (Liu Chia Liang) films usually had a strong traditional emphasis on martial virtue and the importance of family. This is very evident in his kung fu comedy &quot;My Young Auntie&quot;, which stars Kara Hui Ying Hung as a young heiress to an esteemed kung fu family embroiled in internal strife. Her gutsy and dauntless performance opposite Lau&amp;#039;s starring role as her calm to psychotic elderly nephew-by-marriage, earned Hui the Best Actress Award at the 1982 Hong Kong Film Awards.\n\nCast: \tLau Kar Leung (Liu Chia Liang)  ||  Kara Hui (Ying Hung)  ||  Hsiao Hou (Hsiao Ho)  ||  Wang Lung Wei (Johnny Wang)  ||  Gordon Liu  ||  Wilson Tong Wai-Shing  ||  Kwan Yung-Moon  ||  Walter Cho Tat-Wah  ||  Yuen Tak  ||  Robert Mak Tak-Law  ||  Wang Ching-Ho  ||  Wang Sha  ||  Ngai Tung-Gwa \n\n_________________\nDo not break the share chain!
