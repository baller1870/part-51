Vol. 4 includes the 55 episodes comprising all episodes from 1999-2000 of Ira Glass&amp;#039;s popular program. These are pulled straight from the WBEZ streaming archives. \n\nIf you like This American Life, and other public radio programs, SUPPORT PUBLIC RADIO! Give to National Public Radio, give to Public Radio International (who distributes This American Life), I make these available because I love the program and think that episodes should be more readily available to put on your personal listening device, but without support from listeners like you and I quality programming like This American Life is not possible. \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c120257ba729d41bc5d23de6c152030041975f8b","amp;dn":"This+American+Life+-+The+Complete+Archives+Vol.+4+%281999-2000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c120257ba729d41bc5d23de6c152030041975f8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,32,37,123,167,41,212,27,197,210,61,230,193,82,3,0,65,151,95,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
