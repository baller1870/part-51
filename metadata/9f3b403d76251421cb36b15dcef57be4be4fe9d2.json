This can be quite problematic, if you do not even know in what language it is written. This talk will show how it is possible to identify the language of a written text and get at least some information about the contents, in order to decide whether a specialist and which specialist is needed to know more.\n\nThe talk deals with the following issues:\n\n1 How to identify a language\n\n    * texts in non-Roman writing systems and how the writing system can show what language we deal with,\n    * how to identify languages with the help of sample texts,\n    * tricks that help to make at least an intelligent guess.\n\n2 How to get an idea about the contents of a text\n\n    * identifying (important) content words and grammar,\n    * quick and dirty translations,\n    * how to translate a text from a language you hardly know.\n\nThe talk will introduce a variety of means, ranging from pre-internet (and pre-computational) approaches to contemporary web resources.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f3b403d76251421cb36b15dcef57be4be4fe9d2","amp;dn":"24c3-2284-en-linguistic_hacking.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f3b403d76251421cb36b15dcef57be4be4fe9d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,59,64,61,118,37,20,33,203,54,177,93,206,245,123,228,190,79,233,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
