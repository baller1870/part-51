It&amp;#039;s kool, fresh and funky. Listen and you see what I mean.   \n\n \nthe mix tape, vol. 1: 60 minutes of funk - album review\nFunkmaster Flex&amp;#039;s The Mix Tape, Vol. 1 recalls hip-hop&amp;#039;s past while pointing toward its future. Featuring a wide array of hip-hop styles graced by amazing freestyle raps by some of the &amp;#039;90s top MCs, the album sounds like a mixtape compiled from the radio and 7&quot; singles -- there&amp;#039;s simply nothing but first-rate music, with no filler whatsoever. Although there are elements of old-school rap as well as modern funk, the daring production and stunning rhymes make The Mix Tape a rarity of mid-&amp;#039;90s hip-hop -- it&amp;#039;s a record that sounds like none of its competition. It announces itself as an instant classic. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide\n\nTHese artists contribute on the mixalbum with freestyles and classic joints.\n\nRedman,MethodMAn,Eric Sermon,Fugees,Krs,Run DmC,Q-TIp - You name it\n\nFor complete info: http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,222450,00.html\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a703bfe8d259adec63440583c1e44b9a1030a8fd","amp;dn":"Funkmaster+FLex+-+The+Mix+tape+Vol.1+-+60Minutes+Of+Funk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a703bfe8d259adec63440583c1e44b9a1030a8fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,3,191,232,210,89,173,236,99,68,5,131,193,228,75,154,16,48,168,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
