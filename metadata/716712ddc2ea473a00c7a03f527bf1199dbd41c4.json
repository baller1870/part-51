Nevertheless, an old acquaintance goes to his place announcing him that his boss wants to see him. Bailey is forced to tell his fiancÃƒÂ©e his cloudy past: hired by a gangster, Whit Sterling, to look for his lover, Catie Moffett, escaped with a substantial sum of money, Bailey found her in Acapulco and fell in love with her; both went away to live to San Francisco, but after giving death to an old Baileys mate who had discovered them, she escaped again.
