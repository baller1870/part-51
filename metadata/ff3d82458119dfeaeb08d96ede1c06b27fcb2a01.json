The title refers to the main character, Mildred Hubble, who is the worst student at Miss Cackle\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Academy for Witches.

The benevolent headmistress, Miss Cackle, is generally understanding, whereas Mildred\\\\\\&amp;#039;s form teacher, the virago Miss Hardbroom (with whom Harry Potter\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Severus Snape is often compared) thinks she just isn\\\\\\&amp;#039;t trying hard enough.\n\n\nOGG Format -q -1\n\nFrom an old tape I have, listenable quality.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff3d82458119dfeaeb08d96ede1c06b27fcb2a01","amp;dn":"The+Worst+Witch+-+Jill+Murphy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff3d82458119dfeaeb08d96ede1c06b27fcb2a01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,61,130,69,129,25,223,234,235,8,217,110,222,28,6,178,127,203,42,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
