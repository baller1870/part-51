The result is an album that touches on multiple aesthetics and genres with a smooth, confident ease, remaining cerebral and thought-provoking while maintaining a laid-back vibe and just sounding damned good.  Definitely worth a listen.\n\n\n=====\nFile format : 192k MP3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7693556a411e1f1ff654552b868eb69f05066b70","amp;dn":"The+Ray+Moody+Trio+-+The+Ray+Moody+Trio+%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7693556a411e1f1ff654552b868eb69f05066b70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,147,85,106,65,30,31,31,246,84,85,43,134,142,182,159,5,6,107,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
