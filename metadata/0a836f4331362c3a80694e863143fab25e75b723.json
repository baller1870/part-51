This version is the same as PerPetRatOrS, but the size has been fixed and padding has been re-introduced in to the ISO (Using FSTFIX).  Due to this, the image is ready to place on a DVD. Please notice the size is still 1.2GB due to being in a compressed form.  The old PerPetRatOrS release was redundant as wiping the image and compressing it, provided exactly the same ratio of compression as just doing only compression (which is what I did).  Anyhow, I released this because many do not know what to do when they get a wiped image, and it can be a great hassle without the correct tools.    \n\n\tThis image has been tested on Ritek G05 fullsize media with Duo Q on a NTSC DOL-001 and works great (This is a USA NTSC console)!  \n\n\nThe game will simply ask you if you would like to use on a 60hz television (NTSC) at the beginning and you just push the A button (it will be outputting a PAL frequency though so it will be flipping when it asks you, but it is still readable).  \n\nGood Classic game, hope you all enjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a836f4331362c3a80694e863143fab25e75b723","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+Rouge+2+PAL+%28can+work+on+modded+NTSC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a836f4331362c3a80694e863143fab25e75b723","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,131,111,67,49,54,44,58,128,105,78,134,49,67,250,178,94,117,183,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
