(perhaps a little)\n\nSo since Tiny firewall does not exist anymore, I have searched for other x64 firewall.(which was included in the former package) \nBut none of any value exists. (perhaps ghostwall, which was far from perfect but free.)\nThis 32 bit Firewall is the best match for a 64 bit environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis package will work on all XP machines. (Both 32 &amp; 64 bit machines)\nBut it was assembled with the x64 machine in mind.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e4a3485b7abe1afae73ee82e97cee8f82bebaf7","amp;dn":"X64+Security+Pack+V2+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e4a3485b7abe1afae73ee82e97cee8f82bebaf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,74,52,133,183,171,225,175,174,115,238,130,233,124,238,143,130,190,186,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
