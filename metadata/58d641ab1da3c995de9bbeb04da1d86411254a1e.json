The file patched-out is called CoreGraphics. Here&amp;#039;s how to fix it:\n\nFind an untouched version of the &quot;CoreGraphics&quot; file (this download) and put it on your OSX86 Mac. Rename the CoreGraphics file to CoreGraphics.bak Move the file (CoreGraphics.bak) to:\n/System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/CoreGraphics.framework/Versions/A\n\nGo into Terminal, type &quot;cd /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/CoreGraphics.framework/Versions/A&quot; , then type:\nchmod 755 CoreGraphics.bak - &quot;ENTER&quot;\nsudo chown root:wheel CoreGraphics.bak - &quot;ENTER&quot;\nsudo mv CoreGraphics CoreGraphics.i386 - &quot;ENTER&quot;\nsudo mv CoreGraphics.bak CoreGraphics - &quot;ENTER&quot;\n\nOkay, now just reboot your computer! After reboot, you computer will have better graphics, and will be able to run PowerPC applications!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58d641ab1da3c995de9bbeb04da1d86411254a1e","amp;dn":"CoreGraphics+original+file%2C+for+OSX86","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58d641ab1da3c995de9bbeb04da1d86411254a1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,214,65,171,29,163,201,149,222,155,190,176,77,161,216,100,17,37,74,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
