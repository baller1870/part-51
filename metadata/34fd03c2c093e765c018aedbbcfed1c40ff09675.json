It even got the musicjournalists blessing when it came out in 1997, and it together with BOLT WARHEAD,Warlocks,D O T F and Tommy T set standards, got respected outside the small HH-community  and made way for new acts with record deals. If i&amp;#039;m not totally wrong I think NLIGHTN got som space in THE SOURCE MAGAZINE after this album. \n\nWell produced by Tommy T and joined by Diaz,Opaque +++  \nFresh,1 in a million &amp; Land of the lost are 3 favorites.\n\nHe\\&amp;#039;s rapping in english,so its also worth a download for non-scandinavians.\n\nFresh in any season.\n\nCheers\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMUSIC 2 DA PPL!!!\n\nI sit on a lot of orginal HipHop albums from 1988-1999 that\n I\\&amp;#039;d like to share.
