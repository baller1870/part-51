Well, naturally, there are some similarities, since most synth bands today are more or less influenced by these giants, but musically they&amp;#039;re a lot closer to German bands like Camouflage and De/Vision, maybe with a few hints of Depeche Mode 86 - 89 or so. \n\n    It seems band is constantly unhappy about things, whining and feeling sorry for themselves, complaining about lost love, the polluted environment, the cold modern society or just life in general (or even the weather). Their particular kind of whining can be liked though. Sometimes they over-do it, but it&amp;#039;s mostly good and works with the genre. Other strong features of the band are the melodies and synth sounds. \n\nSimilar Artists: Camouflage, Depeche Mode, De/Vision, Electronic, Float, Kiethevez, Kliche, New Order, The Other Two, Statemachine, Static Icon\n\n\nThe Mobile Homes | &amp;#039;Hurt&amp;#039; CD 1990\n\n\nTrack: \tName: \tTime:\n1. \tIs There Life Before Death? \t0:39\n2. \tHurt \t\t\t\t4:38\n3. \tFaith \t\t\t\t3:17\n4. \tThe Mountains Are Growing \t4:53\n5. \tHoping For Rain \t\t4:03\n6. \tSomething Better \t\t4:18\n7. \tLost The Lust \t\t\t4:51\n8. \tBetween Decay And Strong Will \t4:14\n9. \tHypocritical \t\t\t3:09\n10. \tStay At Home \t\t\t3:49\n11. \tI&amp;#039;ll Never Find Anyone \t\t2:33\n  \tTotal \t40:39\n\n\nEncoded with lame 3.97 -V4 --vbr-new (~170 kbit/s) and should be close to perceptual transparency.\n\n\nKids, always remember Xenu is your friend.\n\nwww.xenu.net\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18f11a0e91aa3799d6980c1406996d3848990ed9","amp;dn":"%5BSynth+%2F+Electronic%5D+Mobile+Homes+-+HURT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18f11a0e91aa3799d6980c1406996d3848990ed9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,241,26,14,145,170,55,153,214,152,12,20,6,153,109,56,72,153,14,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
