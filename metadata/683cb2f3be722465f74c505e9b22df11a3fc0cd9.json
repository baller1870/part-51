It sits geographically and \n\npolitically between East and West and as recently as 2000, Turks had a \n\ncomparatively favourable view of the US.\nA more recent survey showed that now just 12% of Turks see the US in a positive \n\nlight.\nAs popular culture, cinema and books begin to reflect this change, Goldfarb asks \n\nwhat can be done to restore trust. \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:683cb2f3be722465f74c505e9b22df11a3fc0cd9","amp;dn":"BBC+World+Service+-+Death+To+America+%5B2007%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"683cb2f3be722465f74c505e9b22df11a3fc0cd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,60,178,243,190,114,36,101,247,76,80,94,155,34,223,17,163,252,12,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
