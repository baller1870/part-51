He   :\n: is one of the fathers of media and cultural studies, developing multi-       :\n: disciplinary theories that focused on things like television and advertising :\n: long before we all realized how important these things were to in our        :\n: society. He has left an impressive legacy. McLuhan&amp;#039;s Wake examines the       :\n: impact of his ideas, while also telling us the story of his life.            :\n:                                                                              :\n: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0391328/                                         :\n:                                                                              :\n: File Name : McLuhans.Wake.avi                                                :\n: File Size (in bytes) : 732,891,136 bytes                                     :\n: Runtime : 01:33:51                                                           :\n:                                                                              :\n: Video Codec : XviD                                                           :\n: Frame Size : 480x272 (AR: 1.765)                                             :\n: FPS : 29.971                                                                 :\n: Video Bitrate : 920 kb/s                                                     :\n: Bits per Pixel : 0.235 bpp                                                   :\n: B-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC: [B-VOP], [], [], []                                 :\n:                                                                              :\n: Audio Codec : 0x0055(MP3, ISO) MPEG-1 Layer 3                                :\n: Sample Rate : 48000 Hz                                                       :\n: Audio Bitrate : 112 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR                                  :\n: No. of audio streams : 1                                                     :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ca1e0b445e6ac8c642d98afda1148a72d8490ac","amp;dn":"McLuhan%5C%27s+Wake","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ca1e0b445e6ac8c642d98afda1148a72d8490ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,161,224,180,69,230,172,140,100,45,152,175,218,17,72,167,45,132,144,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
