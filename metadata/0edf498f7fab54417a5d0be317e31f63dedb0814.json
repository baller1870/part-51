His crime - \nselling marijuana seeds over the Internet.  An occupation he has never denied.  \nIn fact for more than a decade he has dutifully filed his income tax returns \nin Canada stating his occupation as &quot;marijuana seed seller&quot;.  He paid his \ntaxes and was left alone by the Canadian authorities.  However Canada&amp;#039;s RCMP \nsuddenly and willingly co-operated when the DEA got him in their sights.\n\nWidely known as &quot;The Prince of Pot,&quot; Emery is the joint smoking publisher of \nCannabis Culture Magazine, founder of the BC Marijuana Party and a lifelong \nrabble-rouser.  And now, according to the DEA, one of the most wanted men in \nthe drug world, up there with the heads of Columbian cocaine cartels, and the \ntop drug trafficker in North America.\n\nHis story is the prism through which director, Nick Wilson, examines the touchy \nissue of sovereignty, the long reach of U.S. drug laws, and Canadian pot \nculture, while spending the summer embedded at the Emery defense headquarters.\n\nEmery believes marijuana is a wonderful, healing drug and that current laws are \nunconstitutional, inhumane, and detrimental to society, far outweighing the \ndamage done to people by the drug itself.  No Canadian has ever gone to jail \nfor selling seeds, and in 35 years only two people have been charged - the last \ngot a $200 fine.  Yet Emery faces 30 years to life in prison under U.S. drug \nlaws if he is extradited to face trail there.\n\nTHE PRINCE OF POT follows Emery through the summer and fall as he plots his \ndefense, attends court hearings and tries to clear the names of his two friends \nwho now face the same fate as him.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Post Information\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPosted by............: festering leper\n\nPosted to............: alt.binaries.multimedia\n                       alt.binaries.tv\n                       alt.binaries.documentaries\n                       alt.binaries.multimedia.documentaries\n                       alt.binaries.tv.canadian\n\nRepost Policy........: None, sorry!
