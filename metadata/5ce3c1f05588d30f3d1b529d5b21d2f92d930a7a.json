Though it could easily hold its own against the Allied forces&amp;#039; tanks, the Panzer III met its match on the Eastern Front against the Russian T-34. By the end of the war, it had been shifted to secondary fronts and was often used as a command tank rather than on the main battlefield.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ce3c1f05588d30f3d1b529d5b21d2f92d930a7a","amp;dn":"Panzer+III%3A+Medium+Tank+%282005%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ce3c1f05588d30f3d1b529d5b21d2f92d930a7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,227,193,240,85,136,211,15,61,27,82,157,91,33,210,249,45,147,10,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
