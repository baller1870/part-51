So don&amp;#039;t do it...or get caught doing it...\n\nThis is the first disk of the US NTSC version of Xenosaga Episode 1: Der Wille Zie Macht.  I ripped it from my version as the Sir Alucard torrent is pretty much dead. I&amp;#039;ll seed as long as I can, but please seed as much as you download!  I&amp;#039;ll upload disk 2 as soon as I verify it works correctly and have enough people seeding disk 1 - usual rules folks!\n\nI haven&amp;#039;t split it into a multi-part file as some people find them difficult to use and aren&amp;#039;t sure what to do with them.  This file is an iso, so you should be able to burn it using Nero, Alcohol or any number of burning programs.  Personally, I recommend Alcohol 120% for this game.  \n\nI also recommend high quality DVD disks!  I can&amp;#039;t stress that enough!  Don&amp;#039;t drop a comment about it not working if you&amp;#039;re using crappy disks, as that&amp;#039;s probably your problem, not the iso.  This works on my ancient, first model, flip-lid-added PS2, so hopefully you shouldn&amp;#039;t have any problems.\n\nNow for the specific stuff:\n\n*ISO format file\n*4.16GB in size (Disk 1)\n*4.36GB in size (Disk 2)\n*4.16GB in size (Disk 3)\n\nI SCREWED UP AND WROTE THE WRONG THING FOR THE TIME YOU DISK SWAP!!!  IGNORE THE README FILE ( well, this bit anyways it took five hours to split, and 6 more to .zip, I was fed up!) AND FOLLOW THIS!\n\n*SAVE AT THE ELSA BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE ABANDONED DOCKS!!! On disk 1 this is the point where the disk will crash after you ask Captain Matthews to leave the dock rather than continue shopping, and so you save throughout the ship.  When the disk ends, switch off your console, boot up Swap Magic (if you&amp;#039;re not modded) and then boot up the second disk.  Load your save and &amp;#039;viola!&amp;#039; you&amp;#039;re on disk 2.\n*SAVE AT THE SONG OF NEPHILIM!!!  On disk 2 for the same reason as above!  Just boot up disk 3 instead and you&amp;#039;re almost finished!\n\nAnd thanks to......alkohol on the Afterdawn forums.  Without your guide, I couldn&amp;#039;t have played a game I bought more than a year ago!!! (and this is in 2007) and to whomever made the original ripkit for automizing the process.\n\nHope this helps anyone who can&amp;#039;t play DVD9 games!\n\nMy email (nice only please): &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;c9a3a6a3a696bda1aca7acb1bda5acbfaca589a1a6bda4a8a0a5e7aaa6a4&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nMy favourite website: www.bobii-tv.com  (free contests and cheap toys!)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbd02938f77c68c7989709b05f26c04b760d256c","amp;dn":"Xenosaga+Episode+1+Der+Wille+Zur+Macht+Disk+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbd02938f77c68c7989709b05f26c04b760d256c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,208,41,56,247,124,104,199,152,151,9,176,95,38,192,75,118,13,37,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
