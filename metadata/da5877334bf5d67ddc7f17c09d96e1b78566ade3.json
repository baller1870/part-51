While there she receives a bump to her head and passes out. She then enters a dream world where she meets Straynap, an angel of death. Straynap becomes her guide and instructs her throughout the game. Arsia - known as Poach to those in Dreamland - learns that Napple Town is in crisis. The seasons Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter need to be rescued by finding the six Napple Petals. Besides rescuing the seasons, the citizens of Napple Town have a vast assortment of problems (approximately seventy) with which Poach must help them. Tasks range from building a house to helping two friends stop fighting with \n\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay of Napple Tale takes place in two distinct sections. Similar to Sonic Adventure, there is a fully 3D hub where the main character, Arsia - known as Poach to those in Dreamland - can interact with the townspeople. The levels, found on the corners of town, and corresponding to the seasons, contain a fixed path with a boss at the end. The enemies encountered along the way sometimes drop recipe pieces or random items. The recipes show four items which, if combined, will create a Paffet. Poach wields a racquet-like weapon which she swings to battle foes. She can double-jump and attack to perform a spinning attack. Health is designated with petals and by finding certain items you can increase your maximum health. Each time Poach falls into a hole or gets attacked she loses half of a petal.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da5877334bf5d67ddc7f17c09d96e1b78566ade3","amp;dn":"Napple+Tale+%28Dreamcast%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da5877334bf5d67ddc7f17c09d96e1b78566ade3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,88,119,51,75,245,214,125,220,127,23,192,157,150,225,183,133,102,173,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
