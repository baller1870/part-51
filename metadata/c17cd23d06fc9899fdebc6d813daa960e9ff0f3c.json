I also updated the FOLDER.MIF so\nthat the main picture show the theme of that season. \nBoth are Rared. If someone what to make 1 big torrent for each \nseasons, go ahead. \n\nJust add the .AVI, .MIS, FOLDER.MIF and FolderX.jpg but \nunrared them so select each files.\n\n******************************************************\nLast change to the rest of text: 2006-11-25\n\nCheck the date above, if not changed, don&amp;#039;t read \nthe rest because it was not changed since the last time.\n\nPlease, seed 1:1 or max. 72hrs because I can&amp;#039;t do that \nalone. Someone else let you have the file, so just give\nback.\n\nYou can upload the .TORRENT on other publics/privates tracker\nMore trackers = more seeders/leechers = more speed overall :D\nI don&amp;#039;t know all of them ;) But keep all the files and \nuse the .TXT for description.\n\nIf your are stuck because no one is seeding, just \nleave a comment in the last episode that was uploaded.\nMe or someone else will help you finish it. But go to \nthe original tracker.\n\nThank&amp;#039;s\n\n******************************************************\nNEW: INFO 2 MIS v2.0.0B6 is out!!!! 2006-11-25\n\nWhat&amp;#039;s new:  Fix a bug whent creating a .MIS from \nIMDB.com within Windows Explorer. \n\n******************************************************\nIf you download a free file anywhere(database/software)\nremember to click on the ads. They do appreciated it. \nIt pays for the bandwidth/site! :D\n\n******************************************************\nSo, what is a .MIS(my own definition)? \n\nA .MIS is a metadata text file(title, description, \ncredit, goofs, chapters...) file formatted to help \nin the organization of all the movies/tv shows/podcast ...\nyou got in folders. It replace the .NFO.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s formated so that players (software and consumer \nelectronics) can use that information(metadata) and\ndisplay it on the screen.\n\nThe .TXT was made from the .MIS text file as the source. \nI only created it to post on sites. Otherwise, I don&amp;#039;t \nuse it.\n\n******************************************************\n\nINFO 2 MIS v2.0.0B6 is free. It&amp;#039;s the app&amp;#039;s that I \nused to create the .MIS. It can also extract\ninformation from imdb.com(with picture), tv.com, \namazon.com(with picture), dvdempire.com (with picture) ....\n\nTook me a second with an episode on tv.com and\na few more for a movies on imdb.com\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mcgrathinfosolution.com/info2mis_en.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mcgrathinfosolution.com/info2mis_en.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n******************************************************\n\nMIS Info Video Basic v2.3.0 is free(no nag)\nand \nMIS Info Video v2.3.0(30 day trial still work after but lose\nparental control, resume playback...and free upgrades\n\nIf you don&amp;#039;t like the internal player, you can configure your\nplayer.
