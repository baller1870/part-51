In &quot;The Bastard&quot;, she plays a beggar girl that becomes a target for evil men plotting to make &quot;The Bastard&quot; a scapegoat for murder because he happens to like the son of a jailed dignitary&amp;#039;s son accused of murder. &quot;The Bastard&quot; is actually a new take on an old Western classic, Alexandre Dumas&amp;#039; &quot;Man In The Iron Mask&quot; where epee and foil fencing is replaced with tornadoes of hands and feet. \n \nCast: Chung Wa  ||  Lily Li Li-Li  ||  Lau Dan  ||  Cheng Miu  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.528741/qx/details.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.528741/qx/details.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n_________________\nDo not break the share chain!
