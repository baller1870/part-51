The clip is expected by late September.\n\n&quot;Queen B&quot; is the first single from PUSCIFER&amp;#039;s debut album, &quot;V Is for Vagina&quot;, due October 30 via Puscifer Entertainment. Other songs set to appear on the album include a cover of the CIRCLE JERKS&amp;#039; &quot;World Up My Ass&quot;, &quot;Dojo&quot; and &quot;Cuntry Boner&quot;.\n\n&quot;This is absolutely just put-it-on-and-move-your-butt -and-get-completely-out-of-your-head music,&quot; Keenan recently told MTV.com about the record. &quot;This is purely body candy. It&amp;#039;s meant to make you feel like I feel when I hear JAMES BROWN, when I hear some old JACKSON 5 or or ARETHA [FRANKLIN]. It&amp;#039;s just that good feeling ÃƒÂ¢?? music that makes you feel good. There&amp;#039;s no math. Nothing wrong with math, but sometimes, it can be exhausting to be that forced, that focused. I&amp;#039;m a big KING CRIMSON fan, but only when I have the energy to be. Sometimes I just want to hear GNARLS BARKLEY.&quot;\n\nPUSCIFER is comprised of a revolving door of contributors, including multi-instrumentalist Danny Lohner; songstress Lisa Germano; TELEFON TEL AVIV&amp;#039;s Joshua Eustis; Jonny Polonsky; PRIMUS&amp;#039; Tim Alexander; model Milla Jovovich; TOOL guitar tech Matt Mitchell; and dark ambient artist Lustmord.\n\nKeenan intends to release PUSCIFER&amp;#039;s debut album without the backing of a major label. But while he&amp;#039;ll fund the album&amp;#039;s release in the U.S., he&amp;#039;ll still need to license the material out for international distribution.\n\nBrought to you by the Bootleg Capital\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bootlegmatrix.netgoo.org/portal.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bootlegmatrix.netgoo.org/portal.htm&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf417eafe8fe1300eb514aad8bc0e12d42c7bce9","amp;dn":"Puscifer+-+Queen+B.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf417eafe8fe1300eb514aad8bc0e12d42c7bce9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,65,126,175,232,254,19,0,235,81,74,173,139,192,225,45,66,199,188,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
