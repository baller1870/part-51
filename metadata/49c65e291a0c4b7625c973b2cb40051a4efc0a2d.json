Ever since the very beginning in the year 2000, the BS.Player? has been one of the world&amp;#039;s most popular multimedia players. It is popular for many reasons, one however should be pointed out: BS.Player? is the first player ever to enable its users to focus on watching the movie instead of dealing with poor computer capabilities or running around looking for a proper setting and codec. \n\nBS.Player? is a Windows Ã‚Â® player that plays back all kinds of all sort of media files ( avi / mpg / asf / wmv / wav / mp3...) and specialises in video and divx playback. It can also display subtitles. Also available are different skins for this player. \nThe BS.Player? 2.0 does not only play, but with the BS.MediaLibrary? it also manages your multimedia content. You can sort the content in playlists, which enable you to work with files faster and more easily. Playlists may be created through the BS.MediaLibrary? module or directly through the primary BS.Player? 2.0 module. \nLast but not least - BS.Player? is a product for the world public so it is equipped with a treasury of subtitle options which enable the users to watch multimedia files in many of the world&amp;#039;s languages.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nWARNING TO ALL BITTORRENT USERS: \n\nDo not download torrents containing DAA or UIF.
