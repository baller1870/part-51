Still in 20 separate pieces (hopefully you can deal with these, and watch the whole thing together, using a playlist).  Sorry about this... I tried to join the files together using FFMPEG, but I found that toward the end of the 3-hour file, the audio got way out of sync.  Better to have 20 separate files with proper sync, I think.\n\nThe New Hampshire primary is tomorrow!  Crazy times...  :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf5b08b291ad4b4451a23beff2508334d2f50e43","amp;dn":"New_Hampshire_Debate_Jan_5_2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf5b08b291ad4b4451a23beff2508334d2f50e43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,91,8,178,145,173,75,68,81,162,59,239,242,80,131,52,210,245,14,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
