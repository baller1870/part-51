His life undergoes a drastic change when he discovers a mysterious notebook, known as the \\\\\\&quot;Death Note\\\\\\&quot;, lying on the ground in the year 2003. The Death Note\\\\\\&amp;#039;s instructions claim that, if a human\\\\\\&amp;#039;s name is written within it, that person shall die. Light is initially skeptical of the Death Note\\\\\\&amp;#039;s genuinity, believing it is just a prank. However, after experimenting with it and killing two criminals, Light is forced to admit the Death Note is real. After meeting with the true owner of the Death Note, a shinigami named Ryuk, Light seeks to become the \\\\\\&quot;God of new world\\\\\\&quot; by passing his judgment on criminals.\n\nSoon, the number of inexplicable deaths of reported criminals catches the attention of the International Police Organization and a mysterious detective known only as \\\\\\&quot;L\\\\\\&quot;. L quickly learns that the serial killer, dubbed by the public as \\\\\\&quot;Kira\\\\\\&quot;, is located in Japan. L also concludes that Kira can kill a person just by knowing their face and name. Light realizes that L will be his greatest nemesis, and a race to prove mental superiority between the two begins.\n\n\nHiVISION Rip from D-NTV, only fucking encoder messed up\n\nVideo: XVID 704x480 (853:480) 29.97fps [Video]\nAudio: AAC 48000Hz stereo [Audio]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55e282b09851765bf85769edc9ace4d188ed51bc","amp;dn":"Death+Note+senpen+Live-action+Movie+%28Directors+cut%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55e282b09851765bf85769edc9ace4d188ed51bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,226,130,176,152,81,118,91,248,87,105,237,201,172,228,209,136,237,81,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
