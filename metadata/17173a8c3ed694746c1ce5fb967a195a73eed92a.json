Tim and Joanne are a hard-working (= boring) couple with a baby. The only thing these couples share is a duplex?until life throws them all a cruel curve. Sex, drugs and rock n&amp;#039; roll are the backdrop to one woman&amp;#039;s recollection of her youth, and the fateful decision that unexpectedly touches her life 25 years later. Engaging performances and a refreshingly unapologetic script populate this story of regret and rebellion. Written and directed by Teresa Hannigan. Principal cast: Zoie Palmer, Allan Hawco, Daniel Petronijevic and Molly Jane Atkinson.
