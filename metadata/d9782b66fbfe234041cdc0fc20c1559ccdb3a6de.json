The units of Red Alert are now crisp and clean thanks to General's great graphics engine. Not everything is here from the original, but players can still choose what countries they want to be. Germany still has tank destroyer, and France still has their cheap old &quot;Grand Cannon&quot;. Red Alert 3 features full campaigns for each fraction, including Yuri. The side bar is back into play in the mod.\n\nAlthough Red Alert 3 is like its original, it is still far different. Since the creators couldn't rewrite the entire game, Yuri's mind control units don't in essence mind control; all they do is kill the driver of the tank or kill the people inside a building to make it neutral. Once neutral, the object may be taken over by the player's forces. The maps in Red Alert 3 are decent and the full campaigns will having you playing for hours. Since this mod goes just a little bit over the top in violence, this must be added:\nWARNING: This mod contains content that may not be suitable for children under 15.\nSorry, but when the mod let's infantry get blown up into little chunks is where I draw the line for a rated &quot;T&quot; game. ;)\n\nRepacked!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9782b66fbfe234041cdc0fc20c1559ccdb3a6de","amp;dn":"C%26C+Generals+mod+RA3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9782b66fbfe234041cdc0fc20c1559ccdb3a6de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,120,43,102,251,254,35,64,65,205,192,252,32,193,85,156,205,179,166,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
