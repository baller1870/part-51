Following his life over the course of three decades, the film follows Leach&amp;#039;s career from soccer thug, through a stint as a doorman and his involvement in the early rave scene, right through to his nadir as an integral part of a gang that ruled London and Essex during the late 80s and early 90s and would culminate in the infamous shotgun deaths of three of the firm&amp;#039;s members in Rettendon.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0a3f0eafbe738cf87b90d90a7b5f67e5dc83ed7","amp;dn":"VO.Rise+Of+The+Footsoldier+%282007%29+%5BDVDRip%5D%5BIngles%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0a3f0eafbe738cf87b90d90a7b5f67e5dc83ed7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,163,240,234,251,231,56,207,135,185,13,144,167,181,246,126,93,200,62,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
