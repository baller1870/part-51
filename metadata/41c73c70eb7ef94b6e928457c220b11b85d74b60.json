Dave busted the moves, as ever. The other addition was the violinist from Uncle Bill (whose name escapes me, apologies) who added some texture to &amp;#039;Cream and The Crock&amp;#039; and an almost western swing/country feel to &amp;#039;Trainspottin&amp;#039;\n\nAs ever, Tim and Rusty had some amusing banter, Tim gracing us with a spot-on impression of Michael Parkinson interviewing Hugh Grant, and sending out hello&amp;#039;s to Rocio and Ruby. I&amp;#039;ll be interested to see how much gets edited down for the telly.\n\nAs regarding the set list, I was fully expecting a slew of cuts from &amp;#039;Dress Me Slowly&amp;#039;. It said some nice things about the band that they could pick out a nicely left of centre selection of older songs.\n\nI&amp;#039;ve long been interested in how a band with a few albums under their belt relates to their earlier material. The re-occuring comment made of the last Dylan tour was that it&amp;#039;s great strength was Bob had come to terms with the iconic &amp;#039;greatest hits&amp;#039; and didn&amp;#039;t mind playing them. It&amp;#039;s a situation unique to music, that a performer can (figuratively) paint their first painting again and again, and if a musician can fully embrace the spectrum of their career and be as happy with a song from their first album as with something they just wrote, it says good things about them.\n\n- Nicholas Boyakovsky","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41c73c70eb7ef94b6e928457c220b11b85d74b60","amp;dn":"You+Am+I+-+Studio+22","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41c73c70eb7ef94b6e928457c220b11b85d74b60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,199,60,112,235,126,249,75,110,146,132,87,194,32,177,27,133,215,75,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
