South Pole Telescope scientists discuss their 280-ton scope, what they hope it will show them -- and what it&amp;#039;s like to live and work on the southernmost continent.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDocumenting Wildlife Across the Globe\nThree world explorers -- a photographer, an acoustician and a scientist -- talk about documenting wildlife in the most remote places on Earth. We&amp;#039;ll track jaguars through the jungles of Belize, scope out rare mountain goats in India, and eavesdrop on barking baboons in Zimbabwe.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAsteroid May Cross Path of Red Planet\nNASA astronomers are monitoring a 164-foot wide asteroid that is headed in the direction of Mars at about 28,000 miles per hour. Scientists say that the space rock has a 1-in-75 chance of colliding with the Red Planet.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBlack Hole Strikes Neighboring Galaxy\nAstronomers have captured an image of a jet of high energy particles leaving a black hole at the center of one galaxy to strike the edge of neighboring galaxy. Black hole jets can produce high levels of radiation, potentially sparking new star formation in their path. The black hole is about 1.4 billion light years away.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAuthors Investigate the Body&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;Mind of Its Own&amp;#039;\nYour brain and body use &quot;maps&quot; to translate incoming sensory signals into meaningful information. Science writers Sandra and Matthew Blakeslee talk about their new book, The Body Has a Mind of Its Own, which explains &quot;body maps&quot; and their role in connecting the body and the brain.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Biggest Science Stories of 2007\nHow will 2007 be remembered in the science history books? From the Nobel Peace Prize being awarded for climate change work, to breakthroughs in stem cell research, guests review the top science stories of the year and discuss which discoveries slipped under the radar.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVolunteers Turn Eyes to Sky for Annual Bird Count\nFor the 108th year, volunteer birders are fanning out across the Americas for the National Audubon Society&amp;#039;s annual birding census. Data collected during the Christmas Bird Count help researchers monitor bird behavior and bird conservation.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMarathon Climate Talks Yield Bali Roadmap\nDelegates at a U.N. climate conference in Bali agreed to a &amp;#039;roadmap&amp;#039; on Saturday that will guide how the international community approaches the issue of global warming through late 2009. The meeting featured widespread criticism of the United States for impeding environmental progress.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nToxins in the Home: Indoor Air Can Be Polluted Too\nThe Environmental Protection Agency says that the air inside your house could be more polluted -- especially with lead, radon, and tobacco smoke -- than the air outdoors. Guests talk about toxic dangers in common household products and in the very materials that make up your house.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNew Year, New Technology: The Gadgets of &amp;#039;08\nTechnology historians might file 2007 as the &quot;Year of the iPhone&quot; or the &quot;Year of Vista&quot; -- but what will 2008 bring? Tom Merritt, a technology journalist from CNET, weighs in with top technology predictions for the coming year, from the rise of Google to a turn toward online television.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPredicting the Future of Reefs in Peril\nIncreasing CO2 levels could greatly shift the chemistry of ocean waters, threatening the existence of most coral species. The fragile reefs also face a phenomenon called &quot;bleaching,&quot; caused by rising temperatures and damage from overfishing, pollution, and oil exploration.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPursuing Comprehensive Health Coverage in the U.S.\nOne of the largest issues facing politicians in the 2008 presidential race is the topic of health care. Experts discuss what steps could be taken to improve health care access. How do other nations approach the issue -- and what can be learned from their programs?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nResearch Reads: The Best Science Books of 2007\nFrom biographies, to doctors&amp;#039; memoirs, to discussions of stem cells and climate change, we&amp;#039;ll talk about the best science-related books published this year. Guests and callers weigh in with their votes for notable science writing of 2007.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNew Biography Chronicles Life of Jesuit Geologist\nPierre Teilhard de Chardin, a priest trained in geology and paleontology, was part of the 1929 team that discovered &quot;Peking Man&quot; -- a pre-human skull that helped introduce homo erectus to the world.  Author Amir Aczel writes about the challenges de Chardin faced in combining his religion with science.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLife on Earth May Have Begun In Between Rocks\nA biophysicist discusses her hypothesis that in the early days of the Earth, organic compounds needed for life may have been synthesized in the tiny spaces between sheets of mica rock.  Previous theories have stated that life first formed in a primordial &quot;soup&quot; of chemicals in an ancient ocean.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEnergy Bill Seeks More Miles for Every Gallon\nEnergy legislation currently moving through Congress could result in an increase in fuel efficiency standards for the U.S. auto fleet -- up to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. Guests discuss the legislation and talk about new research that seeks to improve the fuel efficiency of cars and trucks.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn Texas, a Skirmish over Evolution in Schools\nThe director of the science curriculum in Texas resigned last month after circulating an e-mail about an upcoming talk on the conflict over evolution and creationism in classrooms. Her supervisor says that forwarding the email implies agency endorsement of the speaker&amp;#039;s position on the issue and that the agency must remain neutral.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUSDA to Allow Older Cows to Be Imported to U.S.\nCanadian cattle up to 8-years-old can now be imported into the U.S. -- previously only younger cattle were allowed, as older cattle are at higher risk of developing so-called &quot;mad cow disease.&quot; The USDA says that a 1999 ban on certain types of feed make the cattle of minimal risk.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Next Horizon in Stem Cell Research\nLast week, researchers announced a significant advance in stem cell science -- they changed skin cells into cells that seem to behave like embryonic stem cells. The work has the potential to sidestep many of the ethical concerns surrounding previous embryonic stem cell research.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54d2059c6e2cabf162b58332efd528e46fde3afa","amp;dn":"NPR+Science+Friday+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54d2059c6e2cabf162b58332efd528e46fde3afa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,210,5,156,110,44,171,241,98,181,131,50,239,213,40,228,111,222,58,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
