It then goes through the parts of the kernel: Mach, which does the typical kernel work like memory management, scheduling and interprocess communication, BSD, which provides the POSIX-style syscall interface, file systems and networking to user mode, and I/O-Kit, the driver infrastructure written in C++. In the end, a short overview on how to extend the kernel with so-called KEXT will be given, as well as an introduction on how to hack the (Open Source) kernel code itself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb665975282ab490d92a45a47a5dad24b350eae4","amp;dn":"24c3-2203-de-chaos_jahresrueckblick.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb665975282ab490d92a45a47a5dad24b350eae4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,102,89,117,40,42,180,144,217,42,69,164,122,93,173,36,179,80,234,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
