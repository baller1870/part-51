These warm periods (we call the current one Global Warming) last from ten to twenty thousand years.  We are in the eighteen thousandth year of our current warm period.  We may be overdue for an ice age.\n\nFear not.  There is a simple solution and it doesnÃƒÂ¢??t involve scrapping your SUV or, strapping solar panels onto your roof, setting up a windmill in your back yard or converting edible grains into alcohol.\n\nLithuania, that little country up in the Baltic where my grandparents were born, has already solved the problem without any apparent problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:483f3408b90a26516aa9991d41041be1ff1f197b","amp;dn":"Global+Warming%2C+Getting+To+The+Bottom+of+it.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"483f3408b90a26516aa9991d41041be1ff1f197b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,63,52,8,185,10,38,81,106,169,153,29,65,4,27,225,255,31,25,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
