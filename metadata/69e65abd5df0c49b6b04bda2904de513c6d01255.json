I tried to explain that my friend John Natchez plays with Beruit and I was making the recording for him (this is true!) but he said &quot;too bad, they don&amp;#039;t own the rights, the group that owns the Avalon owns the copyright. You don&amp;#039;t want to deal with them...so take this recorder to your car, and when you come back I&amp;#039;m gonna search you.&quot;\n\nI figured it would be silly to waste time arguing with a giant dude with no neck. However, it was absurd. The most absurd part is bands not being able to record their own fucking shows. A close second is the fact that he stopped me from recording with a little Cowan iAudio recorder, while at the same moment if you looked down across the crowd there was a glowing sea of cell phones that people were using to record video, snap photos, and record audio clips. I didn&amp;#039;t see them taking away everyone&amp;#039;s cell phones... \n\nAaaah well, fuck em. Enjoy the music, the first two tracks are the two opening acts, then there&amp;#039;s what i got of Beruit (4 songs), then I stuck on the song &amp;#039;amapola&amp;#039; by fosforo cause i think that people who like beruit will appreciate the vibe. If you like it, please go to a show, buy some merch, post about it on your blog, or otherwise do something to show the love.\n\npeace\t\t\nschock\n\n--  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.indymedia.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.indymedia.org&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thought-thieves.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thought-thieves.org&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fosforo.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fosforo.net&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69e65abd5df0c49b6b04bda2904de513c6d01255","amp;dn":"beruit+at+avalon+LA+oct+11","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69e65abd5df0c49b6b04bda2904de513c6d01255","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,230,90,189,93,240,196,155,107,4,189,162,144,77,229,19,198,208,18,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
