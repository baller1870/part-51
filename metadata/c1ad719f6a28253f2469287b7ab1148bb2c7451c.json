Silver. Land. Opportunity. But first, you had to get there!\n\nIn 1869, one of the greatest building achievements in history the Transcontinental Railroad was completed. But for the stalwart settlers willing to risk it all, the American West was far from conquered. Travel on the thin steel ribbon of the railroad was a dangerous, even deadly, affair.
