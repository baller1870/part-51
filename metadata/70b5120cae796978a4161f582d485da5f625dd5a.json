But some are determined to\nstay and are fighting back. The Yizhakis family make up a small\nnumber of the eight thousand Jewish settlers who will be forced\nto leave their homes and relocate to Israel. The filming of this\ndocumentary began in March 2004 when Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel\nSharon\\&amp;#039;s plan to pull out of Gaza seemed far from being implemented.\nBut as this became a reality, Arik and Dayta Yizhaki, unwilling to\nleave, became politically active and turned into two of the most\npassionate advocates of the settler\\&amp;#039;s struggle. The Last Stand\nchronicles the painful and dramatic process of abandoning one\\&amp;#039;s\nhome and follows the fascinating transformation of two working\nclass Israelis into the leaders of a political movement.\n\n_________________________________________________________________d0x__\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70b5120cae796978a4161f582d485da5f625dd5a","amp;dn":"The+Last+Stand+%28Israeli+Gaza+Withdrawal%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70b5120cae796978a4161f582d485da5f625dd5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,181,18,12,174,121,105,120,164,22,31,88,45,72,93,165,246,37,221,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
