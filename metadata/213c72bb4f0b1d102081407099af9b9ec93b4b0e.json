His father rents a room to a young drifter, Carla (Linda Fiorentino). Swain falls in love with her and she helps him stay focused and prevents him from losing sight of his goals. Although a lower-budget film than Flashdance or Top Gun, this movie is similar in theme and style. Madonna makes her first appearance in a major motion picture as a lead singer in a local band performing her hit songs \\&quot;Crazy For You\\&quot; and \\&quot;Gambler\\&quot;.\n\n\nDownload and SEED.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:213c72bb4f0b1d102081407099af9b9ec93b4b0e","amp;dn":"Vision+Quest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"213c72bb4f0b1d102081407099af9b9ec93b4b0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,60,114,187,79,11,29,16,32,129,64,112,153,175,155,158,201,59,75,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
