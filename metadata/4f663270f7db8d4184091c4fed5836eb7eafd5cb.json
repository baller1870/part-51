Pirates and townsfolk alike would have heard all \n\nof these at one time or another in the pubs, at dances, and at various \n\naffairs of state. All are fine reproductions played on period \n\ninstruments. Sound quality is 320 kbs or better. Enjoy!\n\n\nColonial America/Early American Roots -- music from the very early \n\ncolonial American period by Hesperus. This is the music of my \n\nancestors. You can tell they had a lot of fun with it.\n\n\nItalian Dance Music -- my favorite of the lot. This is the stuff that \n\nBaroque music grew out of. A lot of it sounds almost modern -- really \n\nswings! You&amp;#039;ve got to hear it to believe it!\n\n\nLa Music du Grand Siecle -- court music written for old Louie the \n\nFourteenth, the Sun King. Church hymns, marching tunes, dance music -- \n\nit&amp;#039;s all there.\n\n\nLa Roque N Roll -- folk music from the late French renaissance. The \n\nAnglo-French boucaniers of the Caribbean doubtless danced many a jig to \n\nthese tunes.\n\n\nPenny Merriments -- a shot of dirty filthy wicked fun straight from the \n\ntaverns of London, some 350 years ago. Sex drugs and rock &amp; roll has \n\nbeen around for a long time, folks...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f663270f7db8d4184091c4fed5836eb7eafd5cb","amp;dn":"Music+from+the+Golden+Age+of+Piracy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f663270f7db8d4184091c4fed5836eb7eafd5cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,102,50,112,247,219,141,65,132,9,28,79,237,88,54,235,126,175,213,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
