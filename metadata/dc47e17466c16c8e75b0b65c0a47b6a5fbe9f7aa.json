In the style of Jame Clavell and Jame Michener, it tells the very personal and often romantic stories of men and women caught up in much larger events - in this case starting with the Japanese invasion of Java and the Dutch exodus of the region. The story spans from 1942 and the fall of Singapore and the American landings at Guadalcanal to the ongoing fight against the Japanese for supremacy in the region, and follows the fortunes of a colourful cast of characters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc47e17466c16c8e75b0b65c0a47b6a5fbe9f7aa","amp;dn":"Bryce+Courtenay+-+The+Persimmon+Tree","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc47e17466c16c8e75b0b65c0a47b6a5fbe9f7aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,71,225,116,102,193,108,142,117,176,182,92,10,71,182,165,251,233,247,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
