This can be quite problematic, if you do not even know in what language it is written. This talk will show how it is possible to identify the language of a written text and get at least some information about the contents, in order to decide whether a specialist and which specialist is needed to know more.\n\nThe talk deals with the following issues:\n\n1 How to identify a language\n\n    * texts in non-Roman writing systems and how the writing system can show what language we deal with,\n    * how to identify languages with the help of sample texts,\n    * tricks that help to make at least an intelligent guess.\n\n2 How to get an idea about the contents of a text\n\n    * identifying (important) content words and grammar,\n    * quick and dirty translations,\n    * how to translate a text from a language you hardly know.\n\nThe talk will introduce a variety of means, ranging from pre-internet (and pre-computational) approaches to contemporary web resources.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43488dfd3cc33aa3c0696b3406b774780d6a9b61","amp;dn":"24c3-2284-en-linguistic_hacking.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43488dfd3cc33aa3c0696b3406b774780d6a9b61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,72,141,253,60,195,58,163,192,105,107,52,6,183,116,120,13,106,155,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
