In the course of five hours, director Stuart Orme tells the epic tale of the idealistic young knight Ivanhoe (Steven Waddington) and his battle against the evil Templar Bois-Guilbert (Ciaran Hinds, whose thoughtful performance gives his dark character a compelling dimension). Caught between the rivalries and religious struggles are Ivanhoe&amp;#039;s betrothed Rowena (Victoria Smurfit) and the brave, beautiful Jewess healer Rebecca (Susan Lynch), who wins Ivanhoe&amp;#039;s heart with her courage.\nSet against the historical backdrop of a Britain straining under the corrupt rule of Prince John while Richard the Lionhearted fights in the Crusades, director Stuart Orme makes up for a small budget (the crowd scenes are somewhat skimpy) with sweep, scale, and the lush green British countryside of verdant forests and rolling hills, where ancient castles still stand.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:794585d1361db8ecdbcf2880b0774ad00255fb2d","amp;dn":"Ivanhoe.ep4of6.1997.BBC.DVDRip.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"794585d1361db8ecdbcf2880b0774ad00255fb2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,69,133,209,54,29,184,236,219,207,40,128,176,119,74,208,2,85,251,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
