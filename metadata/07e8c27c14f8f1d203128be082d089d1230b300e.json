However, amongst the text there are a few sketches in the background of Model ZX, Prairie, the three Operators, and what looks like two unused X models.  Also 3 pieces of art that were seen in-game in ZX.&quot;\n\n- All credits to Rockman Perfect Memories.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07e8c27c14f8f1d203128be082d089d1230b300e","amp;dn":"ZX+Tunes+Scans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07e8c27c14f8f1d203128be082d089d1230b300e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,232,194,124,20,248,241,210,3,18,139,224,130,208,137,209,35,11,48,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
