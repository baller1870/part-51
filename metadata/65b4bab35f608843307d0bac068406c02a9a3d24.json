Huggins later adapted this story into an episode of Warner Bros&amp;#039; ABC TV series Conflict entitled &quot;Anything for Money&quot;, broadcast on 16 Apr 1957, starring Efrem Zimbalist Jr. This led to the idea of building a series around the private eye character. The feature-length &quot;Girl on the Run&quot;, which was used for pre-screening, had Stu Bailey as the lead and Edd Byrnes as the murderer. Now in this episode the show takes shape with co-star Roger Smith as partner, Jeff Spencer, Edd Byrnes transformed by popular demand into &quot;Kookie&quot; the car park attendant, and Jacqueline Beer as Suzanne Favray, the firms secretary. It also now has its catchy theme song.\n\nGuest stars: Kathleen Crowley (Ann Melville) , Peter Breck (Charles Dixon), Jeanne Cooper (Jean Kingsley), Barney Phillips (Coletti), John Dodsworth (Martin Melville), Irving Bacon (Manager), Gordon Richards (Butler), Michael Carr (Policeman)\nOriginal Air Date: 17 October 1958\n\nXviD/416x304/mp3/45min\n\nLeave a comment if you&amp;#039;d like to see more of this series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65b4bab35f608843307d0bac068406c02a9a3d24","amp;dn":"77+Sunset+Strip+102+Lovely+Lady+Pity+Me","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65b4bab35f608843307d0bac068406c02a9a3d24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,180,186,179,95,96,136,67,48,125,11,172,6,132,6,192,42,154,61,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
