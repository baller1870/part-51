All communications are kept in the strictest confidence--unless otherwise requested, published material is identified only by the author&amp;#039;s initials and state of residence. The mailing list is not for sale, rent, or loan. Think of The Entheogen Review as a network newsletter; the voice of a community of subscribers seeking and sharing information on the cultivation, extraction, and ritual use of entheogens. Subjective results experienced by readers are published too. The Entheogen Review is dedicated to bringing you the latest, most accurate and novel data possible on these and related topics--information you cannot find anywhere else!
