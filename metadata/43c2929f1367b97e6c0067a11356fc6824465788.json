Cervantes created a fictional origin for the story\nin the character of the Morisco historian, Cide Hamete Benengeli, whom\nhe claims to have hired to translate the story from an Arabic\nmanuscript he found in Toledo&amp;#039;s bedraggled old Jewish quarter.\n\nThe protagonist, Alonso Quixano, is a minor landowner who has read so\nmany stories of chivalry that he descends into fantasy and becomes\nconvinced he is a knight errant. Together with his companion Sancho\nPanza, the self-styled Don Quixote de la Mancha sets out in search of\nadventures. His &quot;lady&quot; is Dulcinea del Toboso, an imaginary object of\nhis courtly love crafted from a neighbouring farmgirl by the\nillusion-struck &quot;knight&quot; (her real name is Aldonza Lorenzo, and she is\ntotally unaware of his feelings for her. In addition, she never\nactually appears in the novel).\n\nPublished in two volumes a decade apart, Don Quixote is the most\ninfluential work of literature to emerge from the Spanish Golden Age\nand perhaps the entire Spanish literary canon. As a founding work of\nmodern Western literature, it regularly appears at or near the top of\nlists of the greatest works of fiction ever published.\n\n(Summary from Wikipedia)\n\n\n__________\nCHAPTERS\n\n01a - Translator&amp;#039;s Preface, Part 1 - 00:45:15 \nRead by: Chip\n\n01b - Translator&amp;#039;s Preface, part 2 - 01:02:51 \nRead by: Chip\n\n02 - Some Commendatory Verses - 00:10:26 \nRead by: Sara Schein\n\n03 - Author&amp;#039;s Preface - 00:16:14 \nRead by: Anita Roy Dobbs\n\n04 - Dedication of Part 1, Chapters 1-3 - 00:46:27 \nRead by: Anita Roy Dobbs\n\n05 - Chapters 4-5 - 00:22:54 \nRead by: Kelly Bescherer\n\n06 - Chapters 6-8 - 00:55:44 \nRead by: Denny Sayers\n\n07 - Chapters 9-13 - 01:01:35 \nRead by: Kirsten Ferreri\n\n08 - Chapters 14-15 - 00:47:15 \nRead by: Cynthia Lyons\n\n09a - Chapter 16 - 00:18:36 \nRead by: Gesine\n\n09b - Chapter 17 - 00:16:11 \nRead by: Kathleen Dang\n\n10a - Chapter 18 - 00:25:52 \nRead by: Marian Brown\n\n10b - Chapter 19 - 00:18:25 \nRead by: Marian Brown\n\n10c - Chapter 20 - 00:33:04 \nRead by: Marian Brown\n\n10d - Chapter 21 - 00:28:58 \nRead by: Marian Brown\n\n10e - Chapter 22 - 00:26:10 \nRead by: Marian Brown\n\n11 - Chapter 23 - 00:26:40 \nRead by: Zachary Brewster-Geisz\n\n12a - Chapter 24 - 00:24:36 \nRead by: Robert Foster\n\n12b - Chapter 25 part 1 - 00:30:46 \nRead by: Robert Foster\n\n12c - Chapter 25 part 2 - 00:13:06 \nRead by: Robert Foster\n\n12d - Chapter 26 - 00:20:25 \nRead by: Robert Foster\n\n12e - Chapter 27 - 00:41:45 \nRead by: Robert Foster\n\n13 - Chapter 28 - 00:30:28 \nRead by: Joplin James\n\n14 - Chapter 29 - 00:30:40 \nRead by: Catherine Fitz\n\n15 - Chapters 30-32 - 00:55:01 \nRead by: Joplin James\n\n16a - Chapter 33 - 00:39:32 \nRead by: Kelly Bescherer\n\n16b - Chapters 34-35 - 00:55:10 \nRead by: Kelly Bescherer\n\n16c - Chapters 36-38 - 00:48:15 \nRead by: Kelly Bescherer\n\n16d - Chapters 39-40 - 00:39:11 \nRead by: Kelly Bescherer\n\n17 - Chapter 41 - 00:57:44 \nRead by: Cynthia Lyons\n\n18a - Chapters 42-43 - 00:43:33 \nRead by: Lizzie Driver\n\n18b - Chapters 44-45 - 00:41:50 \nRead by: Lizzie Driver\n\n18c - Chapter 46 - 00:20:58 \nRead by: Lizzie Driver\n\n19 - Chapters 47-49 - 00:59:08 \nRead by: Andy Minter\n\n20 - Chapter 50 - 00:14:07 \nRead by: Katy Preston\n\n21 - Chapters 51-52 - 00:47:44 \nRead by: Denny Sayers\n\n__________\nLICENSE\n\nPlease note that this recording is in the public domain:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/&lt;/a&gt; \nThus, you are free to copy, distribute, display, and perform \nthe work without restriction.\n\n\n__________\nPARTNERS\n\nOur audio files are hosted by the Internet Archive \n(www.archive.org)\nMost of our books come from Project Gutenberg \n(www.gutenberg.org).\nMany thanks to them.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43c2929f1367b97e6c0067a11356fc6824465788","amp;dn":"Audiobook+-+Don+Quixote+Vol+1+-+Miguel+de+Cervantes+Saavedra+-+O","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43c2929f1367b97e6c0067a11356fc6824465788","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,194,146,159,19,103,185,126,108,0,103,161,19,86,252,104,36,70,87,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
