This band was from the Boston area, and released this one album in 1976. Like the group Tavares, they were Cape Verdian from Portugal, and their music was somewhat of a similar sound. This is an all over the place album-disco, r &amp; b ballads, funk, pop-but it works pretty well for the most part.\nI was aware of this band years ago, but didn&amp;#039;t find this album until about 15 years ago in a used record store. A few years back, I found a new, sealed copy of the LP on eBay, and that&amp;#039;s the copy I used to rip these files. What you hear is the first playing of thirty year old virgin vinyl. I transferred it at 312Kbps, and it sounds great.\nI encourage you to give this a listen and seed it for others to discover. I include a crappy jpg file of the front and back covers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cffeae338ede87f96bb9d0b72c0f5c791670604","amp;dn":"Hitchhikers+-+Hitchhikers+%281976%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cffeae338ede87f96bb9d0b72c0f5c791670604","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,255,234,227,56,237,232,127,150,187,157,11,114,192,245,199,145,103,6,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
