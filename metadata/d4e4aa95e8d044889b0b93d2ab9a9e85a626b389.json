I&amp;#039;m using XP myself, and it works like a charm, but I&amp;#039;ve seen reports that Vista for some reason &quot;shuts down&quot; the direct connection after some time with no activity.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4e4aa95e8d044889b0b93d2ab9a9e85a626b389","amp;dn":"MSN+%2F+Live+Messenger+Hijack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4e4aa95e8d044889b0b93d2ab9a9e85a626b389","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,228,170,149,232,208,68,136,155,11,147,210,171,154,158,133,166,38,179,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
