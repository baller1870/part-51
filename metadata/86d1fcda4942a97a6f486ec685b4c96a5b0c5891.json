It was produced by the Jim Henson Company and Hallmark Entertainment, and filmed in Australia. Drawing on Henson&amp;#039;s traditional expertise in puppetry, two of the main characters are animatronic puppets.\n\nThe show was abruptly canceled after it had completed production of its fourth season, with a fifth season contracted, effectively ending the series on a cliffhanger.
