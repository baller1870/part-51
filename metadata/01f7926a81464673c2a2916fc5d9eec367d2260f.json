Formerly titled &quot;Tru&quot;, American Gangster is a biopic of Harlem heroin kingpin Frank Lucas. Lucas grew up in rural, segregated North Carolina where he watched as his cousin was shot by the Klan for looking at a white girl. In the early 1970s he became the biggest heroin dealer in Harlem with a smuggling scheme that imported heroin out of Southeast Asia in the caskets of dead Vietnam soldiers. He soon made upwards of one million dollars a day in drug sales. American Gangster centers on narcotics lawman Richie Roberts&amp;#039; struggle to bring down Lucas, whose flamboyant style earned him the street name &quot;Superfly&quot;, and catching the crooked cops and drug dealers who profited from Lucas&amp;#039;s scheme.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01f7926a81464673c2a2916fc5d9eec367d2260f","amp;dn":"American+Gangster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01f7926a81464673c2a2916fc5d9eec367d2260f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,247,146,106,129,70,70,115,194,162,145,111,197,217,238,195,103,210,38,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
