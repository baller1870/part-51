This brought together a group of artists who had been admiring one another&amp;#039;s musical abilities while playing the same circuit. In doing so, they create a well balanced fusion of heavy, progressive rock with accessible melodies and hooks. \n\nNoosphere has shared the stage with many national acts such as Slayer, Breaking Benjamin, Killswitch Engage, Mastodon, (HeD)pe, Saliva, Systematic, Stereomud, Mushroomhead, Dope, and Silvertide. \n\nThe band is proud to be sponsored by JÃƒÂ¤germeister and to have played on the &amp;#039;03, &amp;#039;04 and &amp;#039;05 JÃƒÂ¤gerMusic Tours. Noosphere also officially endorses a number of companies and their products - namely, Line6, Digitech, Diezel, Salwender Amplification, Vigier Guitars, Digital Music Corp., Voodoolab, Rocktron, WHITEBOY Clothing, Seymour Duncan, and 9mmSFX. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b785794aa33eec0fd596f6d227ec4a2947a7f279","amp;dn":"Noospher+-+Always+and+Never+%28fans+of+Killswitch%2FSevendust+-+awes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b785794aa33eec0fd596f6d227ec4a2947a7f279","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,133,121,74,163,62,236,15,213,150,246,210,39,236,74,41,71,167,242,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
