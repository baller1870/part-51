The strange kidnapping of Bill Drake, Father Gilbert?s best friend. Two unrelated events--but are they? In Secrets, the clues are scattered far and wide, over space and time, and putting them together seems impossible. The newly-captured kidnapper certainly isn?t going to admit to anything. And Bill Drake?s heart condition is like a ticking bomb--forcing Father Gilbert to choose between his ruthless instincts as a former detective and his calling as a compassionate priest. Time is running out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7a2a9e1538f348b847f23cf308ad9a314836ae7","amp;dn":"Father+Gilbert+Mysteries+-+Secrets","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7a2a9e1538f348b847f23cf308ad9a314836ae7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,162,169,225,83,143,52,139,132,127,35,207,48,138,217,163,20,131,106,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
