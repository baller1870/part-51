The sluggishness you may experience when you use your PC is most likely due to file fragmentation and a non-optimized state. UltimateDefrag restores the same sprightly performance as a new PC and new hard drive. If you already have a fast system - watch UltimateDefrag further accelerate your performance and bring out the true performance potential of your state-of-the-art PC. \n\n    *\n\n      Strategic File Placement Gives You Complete Control Over Which Files And Programs You Want Increased Performance From\n      Accelerate the performance of your favorite games, simulations and applications. UltimateDefrag lets you do it. Select individual programs or file types. e.g. Place your .exe and .dll files to the high performing areas of your hard drive and watch all your programs launch with amazing speed. \n\n    *\n\n      Place Unused Data (such as ZIP Files and unused Windows files) Out Of The Way\n      ZIP files and archived data that you never use now have a specific place on your hard drive - the slower unused areas. This makes way for the files you want performance from to achieve that optimum performance you so badly want. Since these files are placed out of the way this is virtually the same effect as those files not even being on your drive at all. Remember the performance when your drive had hardly any data on it? You now have that same performance back again! \n\n    *\n\n      Place Directories In The Optimum Position For Superior Performance\n      Another significant cause of reduced and sluggish performance is the scattering of directories/folders all over your hard drive in no particular order. It&amp;#039;s as big a cause of reduced performance as fragmentation. When you access a file - hard drive needs to query the MFT (Master File Table), then the directory, then access the file. The MFT/directory transactions can often be multiple transactions before it finds the file it needs. The more scattered, the more travel, the slower the performance. UltimateDefrag takes all of your directories and puts them together and in the best position possible for accelerated performance. \n\n    *\n\n      Defrag with as little as 1% FREE space\n      Windows native defragger and other defraggers can require as much as 15-20% free space to defrag. UltimateDefrag can defrag  an almost-full drive with only 1 to 3% free space! \n\n    *\n\n      Enjoy fast 3 to 5 minute complete defrags\n      With all the unused data placed out of the way of the data you use, it more or less stays out of the way of the defrag process. As a result, maintenance defrags finish fast. Usually - just a few minutes! UltimateDefrag also uses clever defragging algorithms that during certain defrag methods only moves files that it has to or only moves the fragments. Assuming that you have a large 1 Gb file. 900 Mb is in one fragment and the other 100 Mb is in 10 fragments - UltimateDefrag only moves the 100 Mb of fragments and appends to the defragmented segment. This vastly shortens defrag runs.  \n\n    *\n\n      Choose From 4 Powerful Defrag Methods With Over 33 Defrag Option Combinations\n      As much power and flexibility as you could ever ask for. Choose folders, file types, days since last use. That doesn&amp;#039;t mean it&amp;#039;s complex or needs to be nursed. It means that it&amp;#039;s powerful and flexible to suit any type of computer use from home system, game system, workstation or server. Just select your parameters and let UltimateDefrag do its thing now and in the future. \n\n    *\n\n      Make Full Drives Perform Almost Like They&amp;#039;ve Been Newly Formatted\n      The net performance effect that UltimateDefrag gives you is the performance of a hard drive that&amp;#039;s been freshly formatted. Faster actually due to the strategic file placement features it adds. Remember that new PC or that freshly formatted drive when your system responded instantly? You&amp;#039;ve got that back again. \n\n    *\n\n      You No Longer Need To Consider Partitioning - UltimateDefrag Is Like Partitioning-On-The-Fly!\n      The more partitions you create, the slower each drive letter becomes. You don&amp;#039;t need to partition any more. The way UltimateDefrag positions your data is akin to partitioning-on-the-fly! Just one volume for each physical drive is all you need. \n\n    *\n\n      The First Complete &quot;DISK&quot; Metaphor In Any Defragger\n      It took some programming but now for the first time, you get to see the true picture of your drive. Hard drives are round and files exist on these circular platters. Now you can see exactly where on your drives your files are. Much better than the square &amp; rectangular representations of the past. \n\n    *\n\n      Say Goodbye To &quot;Hard Drive Fatigue&quot; Forever!\n      As hard drives become full and files scattered and fragmented, performance drags and becomes sluggish. Your hard drive becomes &quot;fatigued&quot;. UltimateDefrag is like a pep-pill for your hard drive. You&amp;#039;ll see the performance increase instantly! \n\n    *\n\n      Based Upon True Scientific And Natural Laws\n      There are some scientific and natural laws that pervade our world that have not made it into the computing world in a ubiquitous way yet. One of those is Pareto&amp;#039;s Principle - the 80/20 rule. Pareto&amp;#039;s Principle states that in anything 20% are vital and 80% are trivial. 80% of the world&amp;#039;s wealth is held by 20% of the world&amp;#039;s people. 80% of problems in a system are due to 20% of the causes. 80% of a companies revenue comes from 20% of its customers. You get the picture. UltimateDefrag applies Pareto&amp;#039;s Principle that states that 80% of the time you only use 20% of the files on your drive. So 80% of the files on your drive are rarely used - the other 20% are often used. So UltimateDefrag gets those 80% of unused files out of the way so they don&amp;#039;t compete with the 20% for the fastest areas of your drive. The result of this can be seen in our thought-experiment below. \n\n    *\n\n      More Than Just A Defragger - It&amp;#039;s Also a File Placement Optimizer\n      Defraggers defrag. UltimateDefrag defrags.... it also optimizes! We find it hard to fathom that over the years the performance issue that was preached was &quot;file fragmentation&quot;. File fragmentation is only part of the performance issue. The more important issue is file placement. See the thought experiment below. It pretty much covers the issue in a nutshell. UltimateDefrag defrags and does the more important thing - lets you strategically place files, file types, applications, folders and directories where they are supposed to be and in the appropriate order for optimum performance. \n\n    *\n\n      Defragging Defrags Your Files - UltimateDefrag Defrags Your File System\n      Regular defragging defrags files. UltimateDefrag looks beyond individual files and defrags and optimizes your file system and drive as a whole. It looks at the bigger picture of your drive. Where files exist on your hard drive, the order in which they exist, the relative position of where they exist are all far more important to performance than a few fragmented files here or there.   \n\n    *\n\n      Nothing &quot;Black Box&quot; about this - you have total control over which files go where\n      Black Box software is software that does what it does, doesn&amp;#039;t tell you what it&amp;#039;s doing and gives you little or no control over what it is doing. Black box is one thing that UltimateDefrag isn&amp;#039;t. It gives you full control and configurability and control over the applications you want performance from. Of course - once you have set it up to you preferences which is a simple process it then keeps your disk maintained as you want it. \n\n    *\n\n      Flexible Scheduling lets you defrag while you&amp;#039;re away from your computer\n      Yes, watching UltimateDefrag&amp;#039;s &quot;disk&quot; in action as you defrag can be hypnotic. You can actually sit there and watch it for hours if you&amp;#039;re that way inclined. But we don&amp;#039;t expect most people to do that. Simply schedule your defrags while you&amp;#039;re away from your computer. Daily, weekly, monthly. Since we use Windows built-in scheduling (configurable through the program) there are no UltimateDefrag services running at any time. This keeps your operating system stable. \n\n    *\n\n      All This In An Incredibly Powerful Program That&amp;#039;s Less Than 1 Mb In Size!\n      Yes, you read correctly - less than 1 Mb. 943Kb to be exact. Remember 3.5 inch floppy disks? UltimateDefrag can fit on one! One of the issues that cause reduced performance of your PC is the ever rapidly growing size of programs and applications. Bigger does not mean better. Bigger does not mean more power and sophistication. Smaller actually means more sophistication! Smaller means more efficiency. And to be able to do what UltimateDefrag does with 943Kb of code is testament to the efficiency and sophistication of this product.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:735a92e9115174e89ae0769aae1e4791620dfc17","amp;dn":"DiskTrix+UltimateDefrag+v1.28-DVT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"735a92e9115174e89ae0769aae1e4791620dfc17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,90,146,233,17,81,116,232,154,224,118,154,174,30,71,145,98,13,252,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
