There are thousands of different skins to choose from that are freely downloadable from the WindowBlinds website.\n\nA WindowBlinds skin can make Windows look like an alternative operating system, like their favorite sports or car brand, or something completely new. Because WindowBlinds uses the latest hardware acceleration features of modern video cards, WindowBlinds won&amp;#039;t slow down your computer and uses very little memory.\n\nWindowBlinds is safe and easy to use. It doesn&amp;#039;t alter any system files and users can switch between the default Windows look and feel and a custom WindowBlinds skin with the click of a button. In addition, WindowBlinds has been tested to ensure it works with Windows Vista, so you know it is compatible, reliable, and more secure.\n\nFeatures:\n* New start menu animation support\n* Category filtering on skins in wbconfig\n* Tag filtering on wallpapers in wbconfig\n* Random skin support\n* The ability to save a re-coloring of a skin as a preset\n* Advanced HSL re-coloring where you pick a single color and a range in a skin and you can just change that color instead of the entire skin\n* Ability to edit the system colors from wbconfig\n* Ability to change skin fonts from wbconfig\n* Ability to control transparency and blur on start menu, menus, taskbar &amp; window frames.

Some integrated graphics solutions and lower-end cards from before 2004 may not be able to use per-pixel skins.\n* On Windows Vista a DWM capable video card is required for per pixel skinning.\n\nINSTALLATION:\n*************\n1) Install WindowBlinds\n2) Close activation window (twice)\n3) Start task-manager and kill:\n-&gt; vista: WbVista.exe (and VistaSrv.exe if listed)\n-&gt; xp: WBINST~1.exe\n4) Start the keyfilemaker and apply the patch to WbSrv.dll\n5) Generate a keyfile and save it in the same folder\n\nNow many are going to download and see that the keygen refers to the SID. Trust me, this will not change ur SID, infact, it puts your computer SID into windowblind WbSrv.dll File. No changing, and as far as Stardock is concerned, you have a legit copy :-)!!!!\n\nNOTE: this is build 32 for XP and 49 for Vista","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eae0d0f92a24f85697b65bb1f5f71c5f85b3cf2c","amp;dn":"Stardock+WindowBlinds+Enhanced+v6.0+%5BNo+change+SID%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eae0d0f92a24f85697b65bb1f5f71c5f85b3cf2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,224,208,249,42,36,248,86,151,182,91,177,245,247,28,95,133,179,207,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
