The terrible conflict in Iraq is a prelude for the even more challenging battles fought by the soldiers returning home - with personal demons, an uncomprehending public, and an indifferent government. As these battles take shape, each soldier becomes a new kind of hero, bearing witness and giving support to other veterans, and learning to fearlessly wield the most powerful weapon of all - the truth.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446345/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446345/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d5a20dbf17eaae5ae47221d70afc125e9d6ec02","amp;dn":"The+Ground+Truth+-+After+The+Killing+Ends+-+2006+-++XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d5a20dbf17eaae5ae47221d70afc125e9d6ec02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,90,32,219,241,126,170,229,174,71,34,29,112,175,193,37,233,214,236,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
