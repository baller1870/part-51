Leaving their hometown of Fulchester in the North of England, Sandra and Tracey head for the bright lights of London, shagging and boozing their way to fame and fortune. Sean Cooley an internationally renowned billionaire suffers a blow to the head, rendering him temporarily insane on the day The Fat Slags arrive in London. Spotting them on a popular daytime TV chat show, he falls in love with their larger than life look and approach. Determined to make them stars, he forces fashion designer Fidor Konstantin to base his next collection around the girls, creating a media sensation. In a whirlwind turn of events, Sandra and Tracey take the UK by storm, hitting number one in the record charts and inadvertently winning the Turner Prize. As far as the press is concerned, fat is the new black... Throughout their journey into the world of celebrity, the girls maintain their unique and endearing vulgarity, coupled with an innocence that draws the British public to their cause. However, in private, jealousy is driving a wedge between Sandra and Tracey as they both vie for the attentions of Cooley. Only when he regains his mental faculties and turns on our unlikely heroines, do they realise that friendship is the only real thing they have in the mad world they&amp;#039;ve become a part of.\n\nDVD Rip, AC3 Audio (5.1), 32Bpp, 719x406\n\nPlease be fair and share.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:614a15e529b1c19c20b7f2cba6123c8b481d59a9","amp;dn":"Fat+Slags+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"614a15e529b1c19c20b7f2cba6123c8b481d59a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,74,21,229,41,177,193,156,32,183,242,203,166,18,60,139,72,29,89,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
