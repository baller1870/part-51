Summertime\n\nReview\n&amp;#039;60s psych, shoegaze, Kraut-rock - there&amp;#039;s plenty of musical influences swirling around in this Chicago-based duo&amp;#039;s debut. Songs About Music is a pulsing romp of a long-player, with just enough meta-music intellect, drones, and guitar fuzz to keep our synapses firing and our toes tapping. --XLR8R \n\nProduct Description\nThis is the new album from Coltrane Motion, two small-town Ohio expatriates now residing in Chicago. Lead singer Michael Bond records sixties- obsessed electronic pop in his home studio, while guitarist Matt Dennewitz covers it all in wailing distortion and delay at their live shows - the result is a raucous wall of sound built out of drum loops and fuzzed-out melodies, held together by swirling synths and organ drones. It&amp;#039;s an indie rock dance record that doesn&amp;#039;t follow the DFA/NME template, leaning more on 90s shoegazers and 60s soul jams than the usual post-punk roll call.\n\n(Amazon.com)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d56bae86bc7d3e172dc1a5789a9fd9ae1f1154a","amp;dn":"Coltrane+Motion+-+Songs+About+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d56bae86bc7d3e172dc1a5789a9fd9ae1f1154a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,86,186,232,107,199,211,225,114,220,26,87,137,169,253,154,225,241,21,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
