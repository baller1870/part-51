The second Two-Gun Kid, Matt Liebowicz (alias &quot;Matt Hawk&quot;--the Liebowicz name was eventually retconned in to replace the original &quot;Hawk&quot;, first appeared in Two-Gun Kid #60 (1962). The latter Kid is better known today, thanks primarily to his connection with and later full integration into the Marvel Universe, not to mention simply being more recent, but the earlier Kid enjoyed a prolific 14-year life span in comics. Two-Gun Kid #60 retconned the Clay Harder character out of existence, turning him into a dime novel character (at a time when comics had just gone up in price from a dime to twelve cents). The two Kids wore different outfits: Clay Harder had bright blond hair and wore an all-black suit with a plackard shirt, a broad-brimmed black hat, and packed two long-barreled pistols with individual overlapping gun belts, while Matt Hawk wore a similar outfit only with an orange-and-black spotted vest, a slightly narrower-brimmed hat, two pistols on a single gun belt, and a black mask covering the top half of his face in the Zorro style. At one point later in the second series, some of the original Kid&amp;#039;s adventures were retouched to make him look like the newer Kid for reprints! Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, creators of the Fantastic Four, concocted the new Kid to make the character resemble a superhero with a secret identity in order to stimulate sales for the title.\n\n\nCategory:\tComics\nSize:\t391.18 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\nFile Name \tSize\n2006 Marvel Milestones - Two-Gun Kid 60 and Rawhide Kid 17 (reprint).cbr \t27.72 MB\n2006 The Mighty Marvel Western Featuring Two-Gun Kid 01 (Steam-DCP).cbr \t24.89 MB\nTorrent downloaded from\t0.05 KB\n\t0.05 KB\ntracked_by_h33t_com.txt \t0.02 KB\nTwo-Gun Kid 033.cbr \t20.18 MB\nTwo-Gun Kid 038.cbr \t8.07 MB\nTwo-Gun Kid 049.cbr \t14.72 MB\nTwo-Gun Kid 051.cbr \t12.79 MB\nTwo-Gun Kid 054.cbr \t12.12 MB\nTwo-Gun Kid 055.cbr \t12.54 MB\nTwo-Gun Kid 061 (36pg c2c) (brigus).cbr \t23.40 MB\nTwo-Gun Kid 064R [Remix - All Stories].cbr \t14.34 MB\nTwo-Gun Kid 069 (36pg c2c) (brigus).cbr \t17.93 MB\nTwo-Gun Kid 076 (36pg c2c) (brigus).cbr \t23.20 MB\nTwo-Gun Kid 078 (36pg c2c) (brigus).cbr \t19.71 MB\nTwo-Gun Kid 080 (36pg c2c) (brigus).cbr \t23.19 MB\nTwo-Gun Kid 081 (36pg c2c) (brigus).cbr \t23.42 MB\nTwo-Gun Kid 086 (36pg c2c) (brigus).cbr \t22.35 MB\nTwo-Gun Kid 087 (36pg c2c) (brigus).cbr \t19.39 MB\nTwo-Gun Kid 088 (36pg c2c) (brigus).cbr \t20.73 MB\nTwo-Gun Kid 089 (36pg c2c) (brigus).cbr \t19.38 MB\nTwo-Gun Kid 092 (36pg c2c) (brigus).cbr \t18.97 MB\nTwo-Gun Kid 60 (remix).cbr \t12.14 MB\n24 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7a0710d64fa5a2fc65868b5dd63186331c5b41c","amp;dn":"Two-Gun+Kid++%28Marvel+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7a0710d64fa5a2fc65868b5dd63186331c5b41c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,160,113,13,100,250,90,47,198,88,104,181,221,99,24,99,49,197,180,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
