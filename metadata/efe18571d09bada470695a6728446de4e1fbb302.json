This documentary never was aired to my knowledge, it was recorded from a hacked satellite tuned to an \\&quot;edit\\&quot; channel which was feeding coast to coast \\&quot;preview programming\\&quot; to network executives in NYC. Apparantly the decision was made against running this program due to its content and the \\&quot;heat\\&quot; that it would generate. The CIA poses as FBI more often than not, so perhaps the \\&quot;FBI\\&quot; stated this would interfere with thier investigation...
