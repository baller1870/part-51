Furthermore, the botherders use fast-flux service networks (FFSNs) to host some of the content. FFSNs use fast-changing DNS entries to build a reliable hosting infrastructure on top of compromised machines. Besides using the botnet for DDoS attacks, the attackers also send lots of spam - most often stock spam, i.e., spam messages that advertise stocks. This talk presents more information about Storm Worm and other aspects of modern cybercrime.\n\nThe first part of the talk provides a brief history of Storm Worm (Peacomm, Nuwar, Zhelatin, ...), focusing on the actual propagation phase. Afterwards, we describe the network communication of the bot in detail and show how we can learn more about the botnet. We were able to infiltrate and analyze in-depth the peer-to-peer network used by Storm Worm and present some measurement results.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cffb64a92ad84055c56fd16eaee3bfbe8ba3ce8","amp;dn":"24c3-2318-en-cybercrime20.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cffb64a92ad84055c56fd16eaee3bfbe8ba3ce8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,255,182,74,146,173,132,5,92,86,253,22,234,238,59,251,232,186,60,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
