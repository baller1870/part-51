Producer George Pal and director Byron Haskin certainly reached a creative plateau back in 1953 that is seldom attained even now in the current age of CGI effects and ear-splitting soundtracks.\n\nI was lucky to attend the 50th anniversary screening in Hollywood recently, with Gene Barry, Ann Robinson, other actors and production people from the film, and &amp;#039;Mr. Sci-Fi&amp;#039; Forrest J. Ackerman, all in attendance. To see it on a full size theater screen for the first time, and with these people there, was the thrill of a lifetime, for sure!\n\nThe Martians and their war machines in this movie are still some of the best and most memorable designs in the history of science fiction films. The color cinematography and musical score also hold up very well. And any film that starts off with the beautiful space art paintings of Chesley Bonestell has my vote of approval. Also, Jack Northrup&amp;#039;s Flying Wing bomber puts in a splendid cameo appearance.\n\nSimply the best &amp;#039;alien invasion&amp;#039; type film ever made - bar none! \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ee5ad4b5511df1478a1ace0877e88e364e0a815","amp;dn":"H.G.+Wells+The+War+Of+The+Worlds","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ee5ad4b5511df1478a1ace0877e88e364e0a815","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,229,173,75,85,17,223,20,120,161,172,224,135,126,136,227,100,224,168,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
