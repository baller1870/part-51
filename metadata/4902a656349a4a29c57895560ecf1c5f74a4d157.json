She is a young Seattle college dropout who is unhappy with life. She is always at odds with her mom, Joy. One day coming back from her temp job as a filing clerk, she is hit by the toliet seat of the re-entering Space Station Mir. Finding out she is now dead, she is recruited to become a grim reaper. As in life, she is a pain in the butt in death. She does not like the details of her job, and is always at loggerheads with her boss Rube. Her fellow grim reapers don&amp;#039;t really take much of a liking to her either. She also learns grim reapers don&amp;#039;t even get a free ride in death, as they must hold down regular jobs along with their death duties.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4902a656349a4a29c57895560ecf1c5f74a4d157","amp;dn":"Dead+Like+Me+S2+DVD1%2F4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4902a656349a4a29c57895560ecf1c5f74a4d157","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,2,166,86,52,154,74,41,197,120,149,86,14,207,28,95,116,164,209,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
