The project was born in early 1997 and it became more than a band, but a way of life for those involved. In 1999 the band selfreleased their first album &quot;Edens In Communion&quot;. 2001 brought the release of NAHEMAH&amp;#039;s second album &quot;Chrysalis&quot; (Iberian Moon Records). Pulling from such influences as Dark Tranquillity or Opeth, the album proved to be very successful and was received well within the media exposure that was attained. The critical acclaim NAHEMAH got from ?Chrysalis? coupled with the 2002 ?most nominated band? reader?s poll in the Spanish metal magazine ?Hell Awaits? allowed for opportunities to open for bigger acts that were touring Spain, such as Moonspell and Alastis as well as a Mexican release of their debut album. 2007 see?s the release of the band?s second full length, ?The Second Philosophy.? With a new record and a new label, NAHEMAH?s desire is to share their art and music with the world.\n\nEnjoy and please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ff4cda46eef28b9532eacfb906d9b81a0d8dae7","amp;dn":"Nahemah-The+Second+Philosophy-2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ff4cda46eef28b9532eacfb906d9b81a0d8dae7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,244,205,164,110,239,40,185,83,46,172,251,144,109,155,129,160,216,218,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
