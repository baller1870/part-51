As one would expect from Musictrade, there is a strong edge of experimental in this compilation, with elements of classical drone ambient combining to innovative use of field recordings and found sound material.\n\nElectroteque&amp;#039;s [Australia] Collective Consciousness is, as the title suggests, a musical insight into various voices and ideas present in today&amp;#039;s collective consciousness, bound together in relaxed and stylish fashion charasteristic to this Sydney based artist. &amp;#039;Birds&amp;#039; by Doc [Finland] and Frags [Sweden] is an ambient adventure into the strangely musical world of birds, based on Doc&amp;#039;s countryside field recordings from summer 2006 and Frags&amp;#039;s ambient groove. Frags also contributes another track &amp;#039;Eleventh of Eleventh&amp;#039;, a calm and soothing meditative piece to relax in. Softspace [England] takes us to his fantastic visual soundworlds with two tracks. Moon&amp;#039;s Halo is reminiscent of floating ice crystals in the upper atmosphere while Hollow Lands brings to mind sci-fi like scenes of Earth in a distant future. KraftiM [Holland] also contributes two tracks: Awl I Can Say is an introspective dive into the depths of a single sung vocal, and Danik builds on KraftiM&amp;#039;s daughter&amp;#039;s humming combined to cool wave material provided by Electrotque. The album closes with cinematic and capturing &amp;#039;Helsinki&amp;#039; by Unknown Forces [Scotland], based on his field recordings from a recent concert trip to Helsinki.\n\n\nTrack listing:\n\n01   Electroteque - Collective Consciousness\t9:25\n02   Doc &amp; Frags - Birds\t\t\t5:54\n03   Softspace - Moon&amp;#039;s Halo\t\t\t6:38\n04   KraftiM - Awl I Can Say\t\t\t5:44\n05   Frags - Eleventh of Eleventh\t\t6:14\n06   Softspace - Hollow Lands\t\t\t6:28\n07   KraftiM - Danik\t\t\t\t6:25\n08   Unknown Forces - Helsinki\t\t\t8:32\n\n       total duration\t\t\t\t55:20\n\n\n\nMore info: \n\nMusictrade website: http://www.musictrade.info\nMusictrade&amp;#039;s Internet Archive pages: http://www.archive.org/details/mt\n\nPrevious Musictrade releases on Pirate Bay:\n\nMT010 http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3591681/\nDoc &amp; Lena Selyanina &amp;#039;Echoes from an Engulfed Cathedral&amp;#039; 24bit FLAC single http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3520817/\nDoc &amp; Lena Selyanina &amp;#039;Reflections on Water&amp;#039; 24bit FLAC single http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3517058/\nMT009flac 24bit http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3517105/\nMT009 http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3547435/\nMT008flac 24bit http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3517092/\nMT008 http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3517092/\nMT007 http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3459597/\nMT006 http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3425437/\nMT005 http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3409502/\nMT004 http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3405718/\nMT003 http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3376551/\nMT002 http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3405718/\nMT001 http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3519855/\n\n\n\nEnjoy,\n\nMusictrade","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0350d2fd27abbd345d5608be201ee7edc16e4fd","amp;dn":"VA+-+Ice+Mustard+%5Bambient%2C+24bit%2F88.2+FLAC%2C+covers%2C+Musictrade%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0350d2fd27abbd345d5608be201ee7edc16e4fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,53,13,47,210,122,187,211,69,213,96,139,226,1,238,126,220,22,228,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
