The family eventually realizes there&amp;#039;s more to Mr. Gordy than just a child&amp;#039;s active imagination. Heidi awakens one night with claw marks on her face and her father Andy soon suffers the same scratches on his back. Mr. Gordy is no longer the only apparition; he&amp;#039;s joined by a hooded, faceless figure and a man with one hand. The family contacts a parapsychologist who attributes the manifestations to energy from a fault-line. Later, a psychic tells them of several spirits in the home, some being good and some being evil. Eventually, they turn to their church for help. Afterwards it seems that the Wyricks&amp;#039; are at peace in their home once again. However at the end of the program, Heidi claims that she sometimes still sees one of the spirits, one that is always black. At the end Heidi plays the piano it is a somewhat ominous peaceful tune.\n\nXviD: 899 kbps (MPG4)(NVOP)(PVOP)(PB)(DF)\nMPEG-2 Layer 3: 22050Hz  56 kb/s tot , Joint Stereo \nResolution: 352 x 240\nFramerate: 29.97\nLength: 1:27:05\nLanguage: English\nSubs: None\n\nThis is very watchable but not the best quality.\n\nThis torrent is already out there but its not listed here on TPB.\n\nUnsolved Mysteries did a segment on this.
