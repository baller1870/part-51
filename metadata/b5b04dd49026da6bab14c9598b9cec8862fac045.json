MY SWEDISH HEART is an expression of love and a tribute to the great Swedish jazz composers from Lars Gullin to her contemporaries. \n\nSweden developed a particularly active jazz scene before all other European countries, helped by the fact that many American greats didn&amp;#039;t just tour in Sweden but also made their homes there. The list is long and impressive: Stan Getz, Art Farmer, Dexter Gordon, Sahib Shihab, Ben Webster, Idrees Sulieman, Bill Evans, Quincy Jones, to name but a few. The musical exchange of these great talents with the local scene resulted in a long list of exceptional local jazz musicians: Lars Gullin, Arne Domnerus, Ake Persson, Rune Gustafsson and Bengt-Arne Wallin. All were accepted as equals by their American friends and peers, even in the 1950s. The album releases from that time bear witness to the high level of musicianship. \n\nFor her new album Viktoria Tolstoy has immersed herself deeply in Swedish jazz culture and selected a special homage from the large choice available. \n\nViktoria Tolstoy ? vocals Jacob Karlzon - grand piano Lars Danielsson - acoustic bass, cello \nPeter Danemo ? drums, percussion Ulf Wakenius - acoustic guitar Nils Landgren ? trombone \n Special guests:  \nAle MÃƒÂ¶ller ? mandola, flute Christian Spering - acoustic bass Wolfgang Haffner ? drums BohuslÃƒÂ¤n Bigband \n\n01 Grandmas Song\n02 Mind if I\n03 From Above\n04 Dialogue\n05 You Gave Me The Flow\n06 Den FÃƒÂ¶rsta GÃƒÂ¥ng\n07 Dannys Dreaming\n08 The Morning Of You\n09 Mayday\n10 I Hope ItÃ‚Â´s Spring For You\n11 Jag Yet En Dejlig Rosa \n\nEnjoy It!!\nUlysses56\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5b04dd49026da6bab14c9598b9cec8862fac045","amp;dn":"Viktoria+Tolstoy-My+Swedish+Heart-2005","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5b04dd49026da6bab14c9598b9cec8862fac045","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,176,77,212,144,38,218,107,171,20,201,89,139,156,236,136,98,250,192,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
