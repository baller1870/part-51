(From Unanimated).\n\nWarAnthem existed only for a short time. War Anthem was the project name.\nOne demo was made but not released.\nOnly a few copies was spread around to the bands friends, and finally to me.\nThis is a demo not recorded in professional studio, however the sound is very good for a demo. \n\nThe sound is dark, slow and powerful. You can also hear the typical sad keyboardsound from Unanimated recording \\Ancient god of evil\\.\n\nInspirations from: Desultory, Dismember, Dissection, Disharmonic Orchestra and more...\n\nFormat: mp3\nQuality: 192kb/s\n\nHopefully this will work this time.\n\n(Do not download earlier published torrents as one audiofile was cut of before the song was ended.)\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb43b024ba7bef276c6af5dd47a82bfa7fe4f449","amp;dn":"War+Anthem-Demo-metal+music-fixed+audiofiles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb43b024ba7bef276c6af5dd47a82bfa7fe4f449","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,67,176,36,186,123,239,39,108,106,245,221,71,168,43,250,127,228,244,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
