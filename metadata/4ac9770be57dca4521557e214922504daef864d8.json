The boxing match at the beginning is priceless.\n\nFull screen, b&amp;w, avi format, no subs, english only, good quality.\n\nTwo Virginians are heading for a new life in Texas when they witness a stagecoach being held up. They decide to rob the robbers and make off with the loot. To escape a posse, they split up and don&amp;#039;t see each other again for a long time. When they do meet up again, they find themselves on different sides of the law. This leads to the increasing estrangement of the two men, who once thought of themselves as brothers.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ac9770be57dca4521557e214922504daef864d8","amp;dn":"Texas+-Glenn+Ford+-William+Holden-1941%28George+Marshall%29+Dvdrip+X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ac9770be57dca4521557e214922504daef864d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,201,119,11,229,125,202,69,33,85,126,33,73,34,80,77,174,248,100,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
