Scene of \n  action is the Soviet Union. Leading Soviet scientists start a big experiment\n  that alter human physiology and mentality in order to create super humans\n  capable of building bright future and communism all over the world. But \n  something goes wrong. As a result the whole city, where that experiment took\n  place, goes on a rampage. The majority of citizens died, and those who \n  survived turned into hideous mutants - the only inhabitants of deserted \n  streets. You Are Empty immerses you in an exaggerated dark and obscure \n  atmosphere of Soviet totalitarianism. Fighting against mutants, that \n  obtained super power after the experiment was carried out, the main hero \n  tries to gain an understanding of what\\&amp;#039;s happening around and save the day.\n   \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f79279dac99bbf306d80638dada94d779f768639","amp;dn":"You.Are.Empty-RELOADED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f79279dac99bbf306d80638dada94d779f768639","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,146,121,218,201,155,191,48,109,128,99,141,173,169,77,119,159,118,134,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
