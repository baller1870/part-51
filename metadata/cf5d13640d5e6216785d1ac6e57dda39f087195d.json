Makes configuration and maintenance much easier, has common applications installed and configured.\n  Uses icewm/rox-filer for window/file managers. Has backup of fluxbox/fox pathfinder.\nInstaller is same setup as Slackware, with a couple changes. Automatically installs  all packages that weight in at 1.74Gb when complete. \nLatest release features a rewritten installer. Still text-based -- but has much better control and also has an UPDATE option, which will only update newer packages than the currently installed version.
