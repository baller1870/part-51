When he is returned to Finland, his confusion intensifies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a0c2279b592c2c9b097aa4ab769db5c47105a93","amp;dn":"%C3%84ideist%C3%A4+parhain+%282005%29+PAL+DVDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a0c2279b592c2c9b097aa4ab769db5c47105a93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,12,34,121,181,146,194,201,176,151,170,74,183,105,219,92,71,16,90,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
