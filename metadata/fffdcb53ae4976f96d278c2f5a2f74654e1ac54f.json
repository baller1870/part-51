Crawling the avenues of New York City when the lights go down... Stalking future fans in naughty chat rooms on the web... Ruthlessly leaving their mark on as many objects - and people - as possible. YouÃƒÂ­ll find the word VALEZE on the breast of your local bartender, the lips of a breathless clubber, And the lonely lamppost on your street corner.\n\nHardworking, determined, and unpretentious, Valeze is making their mark in every way, whether hustling the streets of NYC any night of the week, touring the Northeast or recording in the studio, most recently with Nic Hard (Bravery, Aberdeen City). Some days you can even catch them sewing outfits for their next show while booking go-go dancers and trapeze artists for one of their upcoming Circus parties. Regardless of what theyÃƒÂ­re doing, you can be sure itÃƒÂ­s something for their fans.\n\nIt took a three and a half years of recording, touring and auditioning to arrive at the current lineup, a five-piece stylish outfit composed of vocalist Tiffany Randol, guitarist Alan Brent, bassist Joe Hung, keyboardist Tim Grace, and Miles Kennedy on the drums. Respected for their DIY attitude and hard work, Valeze has independently toured the Northeast, West Coast, and Canada; shared the stage with such well-respected acts as the Samples, American Minor, Diamond Nights, and the Redwalls; garnered sponsorships from companies such as Sam Ash, Garnier Fructis, Amp Energy/Mountain Dew, and Voice Verified; created their own underground scene unlike any other in NYC with their successfully debaucherous Circus parties; and most recently, made major strides in the studio working alongside Nic Hard to generate songs for their upcoming album.\n\nWell-known club DJs are spinning the bandÃƒÂ­s tracks in the club circuit, while eager street-teamers spread the word on the streets and on the Net. There is a real buzz going on, and ValezeÃƒÂ­s appeal reaches a unique range of fans: punk rockers to gay club goers and everyone in between.\n\nBut what does VALEZE sound like?\n\nBuilding on their influences from the seminal bands of the late ÃƒÂ­70s - Blondie, the Clash, and the Sex Pistols in particular - Valeze has cultivated a sound all their own. ItÃƒÂ­s a sound that you can only achieve when you have a sexy frontwoman whose vocal influences include Axl Rose, Billy Idol, and Elvis Presley, and then you combine them with danceable elements of new wave, glam, and punk. Dare we say ÃƒÂ± if Axl had tits? (Or does he now...?)\n\nThis band does not limit itself to one particular style, nor attempt to imitate anyone elseÃƒÂ­s sound. These five have their own voice ÃƒÂ³ musically, image-wise, and even in the way they have emerged from the scene using Circus as a stepping-stone. Together as a unit, the group is unique and has a story to tell - perhaps too many!\n\nAlthough these bands are not necessarily influences, fans of Berlin, Missing Persons, No Doubt, the Killers, and the Sounds tend to go wild for Valeze. Clearly, typical dance-rock they are not. Yes ÃƒÂ± you will rock out, and yes, concertgoers love to dance (at least when theyÃƒÂ­re allowed to in NYC), but itÃƒÂ­s the unusual combination of great songs, energy, and elements of surprise at a Valeze show that keeps people coming back for more! With Valeze, you get the whole package - good production, tremendous live energy, smart songcraft, and star quality to spare.\n\n\nÃƒÂ¬Valeze has got their feet firmly planted in BlondieÃƒÂ­s footsteps. Fronted by classically-trained Tiffany Randol, this band (with their frenetic breakdowns and breathy vocals) will take you right back to Studio 54!ÃƒÂ® ÃƒÂ³ NY Press\n\nWebsite &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.valeze.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.valeze.net&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDiscography\n-Valeze \\&quot;GO, GO, GO!\\&quot; EP - Release date August 2006.
