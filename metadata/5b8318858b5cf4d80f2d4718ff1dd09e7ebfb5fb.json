It was a perfect instrument, never cracking, and with a gorgeous tone. His Romanian Gypsy (lautari) music was elegantly soulful and passionate, from the aching \\\\\\&quot;La Salul Cel Negru\\\\\\&quot; to the sprightly \\\\\\&quot;De Trei Ani Nu Dau Pe Acasa.\\\\\\&quot; The recordings on Sounds from a Bygone Age, Vol. 3, from the early \\\\\\&amp;#039;60s, are timeless in their beauty. Siminica was a good violinist, but it was his singing that won him fame. Born in 1926 and dying in the early \\\\\\&amp;#039;80s, he was an icon in the cafes and bars of Bucharest. The musicians on these recordings, some of whom have never been released outside Romania on CD before, are superb, especially accordionist Faramita Lambru. He was one of the few who could cross the divide between Gypsy and Romanian songs, and did so with aplomb. This is a remarkable album from the archives, a little slice of history that captivates.\n\nThe sound is great too! The communist was high on High End...\n\nRecommended for all music lovers out there.\n\nDownload, share &amp; enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b8318858b5cf4d80f2d4718ff1dd09e7ebfb5fb","amp;dn":"Dona+Dimitru+Siminica++-+Sounds+from+a+bygone+age+-+Vol.+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b8318858b5cf4d80f2d4718ff1dd09e7ebfb5fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,131,24,133,139,92,244,216,15,45,71,24,255,29,208,158,126,191,181,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
