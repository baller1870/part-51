As a comedy in the same violent way as Pulp Fiction, but happening in a small Swedish town during winter, this movie is just good entertainment.\n\nAndreas Wilson plays Jojo, a poor young guy in love with his girlfriend Anso (Sara Sommerfeld), but with too little money for a proper house or apartment. Anso has a strong disagreement with her father Baba (Hassan Brijany) who is selling and buying cars, and not always so much according to the law. Then Jojo ends up helping Baba with one Cadillac, full of Russian drug money...\n\nThe wonderful combination of different nationals and languages was probably the funniest part of this movie. We&amp;#039;ve seen people blown up for the sake of fun in other movies as well, but Babas bilar brings the new aspect of different nationalities and stereotypes into this &quot;fish soup&quot;. The Russian drug dealer and his three Finnish bodyguards, a Norwegian car buyer along with the Swedes just cook up something funny together. As a Finn myself, I was laughing a lot when seeing the oh-so-familiar behaviour of Finnish males in sauna, played by three very popular Finnish actors (Peter Franzen, Jarmo MÃƒÂ¤kinen and Hannu Kiviaho).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:149db9082b43c5aa306d402f4e5f0b6c452171f6","amp;dn":"Babas+bilar.dvdr+%2Cswe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"149db9082b43c5aa306d402f4e5f0b6c452171f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,157,185,8,43,67,197,170,48,109,64,47,78,95,11,108,69,33,113,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
