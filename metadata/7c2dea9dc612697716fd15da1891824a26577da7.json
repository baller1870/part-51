It has the following features, along with others\n\n\n- It focuses on files and directories instead of lists of files. Thus, once you load a file, you can easily navigate through all other files in the same directory.\n- It displays images at their native resolution instead of interpreting DPI information stored in the image meta-data. While images are printed at the maximum resolution possible, on screen they are displayed pixel-by-pixel.\n- Being designed more for viewing of Images, it properly shows animated GIF files.\n- The entire program can easily be manipulated and powered by simple keystrokes for a quick and pleasant viewing experience.\n- JustLooking also supports such basic features as printing and rotating and will hopefully prove to be sufficiently functional for most users\\&amp;#039; needs.\n\n\nRunning JustLooking is quite simple, and the only requirements are:\n\n- Mac OS X 10.4 or greater\n- 256MB RAM\n- 2MB free disk space\n\nJustLooking is installed on any new machine by simply dragging it into the Applications folder.\n\nmore information at &lt;a href=\\&amp;#039;http://chipmunkninja.com.\\&amp;#039;&gt;http://chipmunkninja.com&lt;/a&gt;.\n\nWe need help with localisation.  If you speak a language other than english fluently, and have 2 hours or so to spare, please let me know -- the more languages the better!!!\n\n\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c2dea9dc612697716fd15da1891824a26577da7","amp;dn":"JustLooking+1.1.0+%28Replacement+for+Preview.app%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c2dea9dc612697716fd15da1891824a26577da7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,45,234,157,198,18,105,119,22,253,21,218,24,145,130,74,38,87,125,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
