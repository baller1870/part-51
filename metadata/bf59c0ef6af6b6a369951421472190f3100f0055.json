It is the town where he came from where very strange things started happening with his arrival in a spaceship in the midst of a meteor storm of green rocks. Clark must deal with a variety of individuals given powers by the green rocks, keep his powers a secret, cope with his friendship with a young Lex Luthor, and balance the two girls in his life, Chloe and Lana. The show also shows us how Lex Luthor develops from a friend of Clark\\&amp;#039;s and kinda-okay guy to (presumably) the villain who will plague Superman in his later years.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCast:\n\nTom Welling, Kristin Kreuk, Michael Rosenbaum, Annette O\\&amp;#039;Toole, John Glover\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nThis is Season 6 Disc 3 will seed until there are enough copies out\n\n\n\nThere is spanish subtitles\nRegion Removed as well\nBurn image file onto standard DVD5 disc!\n\nEnjoy\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf59c0ef6af6b6a369951421472190f3100f0055","amp;dn":"SMALLVILLE+Season+6+Disc+3+%28DVD5%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf59c0ef6af6b6a369951421472190f3100f0055","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,89,192,239,106,246,182,163,105,149,20,33,71,33,144,243,16,15,0,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
