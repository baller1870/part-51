Finding himself sandwiched between\nBible-thumping good-girl Angel and her bad-girl sister Ann, a musclebound\nbiker named Herschell falls under Ann\\\\\\&amp;#039;s seductive spell when she offers him\nsome weed.  Quickly becoming a writhing, spastic addict - \\\\\\&quot;I have a feeling\nI\\\\\\&amp;#039;m hooked!\\\\\\&quot; - the big galoot then gets a job at a turkey farm where he\\\\\\&amp;#039;s\nfed meat with an experimental drug, and like any junkie who eats tainted\nturkey meat, turns into a man with a giant turkey head.  Yes, a man with a\ngiant turkey head.  Who also gobbles like a big dumb bird.  Still hungry for\na fix, Herschell-the-Turkey-Man proceeds to attack fellow drug addicts whose\nblood he drinks with his pointy little turkey beak.  In one magical moment,\nhe even buzz-saws the leg off a pusher who holds his stump and howls for\nwhat seems like days.  All of which is punctuated by philosophical pondering\nby co-director Brad Grinter before two potheads with a machete decide to go\non their version of a turkey shoot.  Wow.  A monster movie unlike any other,\nBlood Freak is a jaw-dropping almost-legendary milestone in crackpot\nfilmmaking, and the ultimate cinematic turkey.\\\\\\&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41aaeb70ba7bbea3b73322128571ff0e4efc4400","amp;dn":"Blood+Freak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41aaeb70ba7bbea3b73322128571ff0e4efc4400","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,170,235,112,186,123,190,163,183,51,34,18,133,113,255,14,78,252,68,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
