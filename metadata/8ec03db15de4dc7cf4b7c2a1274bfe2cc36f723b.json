Mr. Harris is now completing a doctorate in neuroscience. His work has been discussed in Newsweek, The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The San Francisco Chronicle, The Chicago Tribune, The Economist, The Guardian, The Independent, The Globe and Mail, New Scientist, Wired, SEED Magazine, and many other journals.\n\nMr. Harris makes regular appearances on television and radio to discuss the danger that religion now poses to modern societies. The End of Faith won the 2005 PEN Award for Nonfiction. Several foreign editions are in press. Mr. Harris lives in New York City.\n\n---------------\n\nAn impassioned plea for reason in a world divided by faith. \n\nThis important and timely book delivers a startling analysis of the clash of faith and reason in today\\&amp;#039;s world. Harris offers a vivid historical tour of mankind\\&amp;#039;s willingness to suspend reason in favor of religious beliefs, even when those beliefs are used to justify harmful behavior and sometimes heinous crimes. He asserts that in the shadow of weapons of mass destruction, we can no longer tolerate views that pit one true god against another. Most controversially, he argues that we cannot afford moderate lip service to religion?an accommodation that only blinds us to the real perils of fundamentalism. While warning against the encroachment of organized religion into world politics, Harris also draws on new evidence from neuroscience and insights from philosophy to explore spirituality as a biological, brain-based need. He calls on us to invoke that need in taking a secular humanistic approach to solving the problems of this world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ec03db15de4dc7cf4b7c2a1274bfe2cc36f723b","amp;dn":"Sam+Harris+-+The+End+of+Faith+%28CSPAN+talk%29+05","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ec03db15de4dc7cf4b7c2a1274bfe2cc36f723b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,192,61,177,93,228,220,124,244,183,194,161,39,75,254,44,195,111,114,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
