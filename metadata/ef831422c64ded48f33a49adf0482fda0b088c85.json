This software will\n optimize your hard disk in Windows XP Home, Windows XP Professional,\n Windows 2000 Professional, and Windows NT 4 Workstation, securely repacking\n fragmented files together for more efficiency. In addition, O&amp;O Defrag V8.0\n Professional Edition boasts outstanding usability and a myriad of important\n functions not found in any other defragmentation software platforms on the\n market today.\n\nThe things I like about O&amp;O Defrag Professional Edition v8.0\n\n   * Complete Automation with O&amp;O OneButtonDefrag\n   * Special support for Notebooks\n   * Defragmentation requiring only 5% free disk space\n   * Functionality with hard disks and partitions of all sizes\n   * 100% file and data secure due to the usage of Microsoft Windows API\n   * Screen Saver Mode for efficient and convenient optimization\n   * Automatic Background Defragmentation\n   * Five different defragmentation methods\n   * Effortless remote administration with O&amp;O TrueRemoteControl (Server Edition)\n   * O&amp;O Defrag Network Management for integrated software distribution and administration on the network (Server Edition)\n   * Compatible with all server variations of Windows 2003/XP/2000/NT 4 (Server Edition)\n   * STEALTH Technology for optimal defragmentation of hard disks of all sizes\n   * Integrated support of Microsoft Active Directory Services and administration of secure communication through TCP/IP (Server Edition)\n   * Defrag more than one drive at a time.\n\nQ&amp;A:\n\nBut I thought NTFS didn\\&amp;#039;t fragment?\n\nEvery file system fragments. Microsoft has now also recognized that NTFS does fragment,\nand even includes a built-in defragmenter in the latest Windows versions.\n\nNewer Windows versions already include a defragmenter.
