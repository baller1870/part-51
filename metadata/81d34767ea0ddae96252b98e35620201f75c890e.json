But as she got older she started seeing that she was more of a female then a male. So she changed her name to Gwen when she was in high school and she was no longer a male. When she was 17 years old she was killed by 3 teenage boys after they discovered she was a male. They beat her for 5 hours before tying her up and throwing her in a grave. Two of the boys were convicted of second-degree murder, and one boy plead out to manslaughter. The judge and jury did not see this as a hate crime and none of the boys were convicted of one.
