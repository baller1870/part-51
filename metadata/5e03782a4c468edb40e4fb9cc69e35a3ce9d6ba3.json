With his best friends, techno-geek Tucker and free-thinking Goth girl Sam, he thwarts the misdeeds of menacing ghosts; and stumbles through daily social hurdles. - Danny Phantom Press Kit.\n\n\n\n&quot;It&amp;#039;s a great comedy/action show that I think you and all the other Nickelodeon animation fans are really going to love. And it&amp;#039;s a bit different than anything Nickelodeon has done before.
