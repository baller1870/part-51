The &quot;No Angel or Demon&quot; single was released in 2002 by Primitive Art Records which caught the ear of Lee Dorrian&amp;#039;s label Rise Above Records, who quickly signed them. A year later, the band were brought back together with Jonas ArnesÃƒÂ©n taking the place of original drummer Jens Henriksson. Their debut album, Witchcraft, was worked on in a basement studio with vintage equipment, which gave them their very seventies-esque sound. In mid-2004, the band toured Europe with Orange Goblin and Grand Magus. The band recorded their second album, Firewood, in England, which was released on Rise Above in 2005. That same year the band toured the U.K. in support of Corrosion of Conformity, backed by the &quot;Chylde of Fire&quot; single. In mid-2006, Jones ArnesÃƒÂ©n left the band and was replaced by original drummer, Jens Henriksson. The band toured the US in latter part of 2006 with Danava. During this tour, on November 11, 2006, Witchcraft performed at the Rock and Roll Hotel in Washington, DC. For their encore they played two Pentagram covers (&quot;When the Screams Come&quot; and &quot;Yes I Do&quot;) with Bobby Liebling on vocals. Their recent EP/singel release, &quot;If Crimson Was Your Colour,&quot; was released on 7&quot; vinyl on November 6, 2006.\n\nThe Alchemist is the third album from the Swedish doom metal band Witchcraft. The album was released in September 2007 by Rise Above Records.\n\nTracklist:\n1.Walk between the lines 3:24\n2.If Crimson was your colour 3:47\n3.Leva 4:34\n4.Hey doctor 5:12\n5.Samaritan burden 6:27\n6.Remembered 5:14\n7.The alchemist pt. 1/2/3 14:36\n\nEnjoy, say thanks &amp; SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5ee30e259db7cff9f3534ecc42e6dad0df329b1","amp;dn":"Witchcraft_-_The_Alchemist-Promo-2007-CMG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5ee30e259db7cff9f3534ecc42e6dad0df329b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,238,48,226,89,219,124,255,159,53,52,236,196,46,109,173,13,243,41,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
