It is not the &quot;official&quot; Washington story, nor is it a &quot;convenient&quot; story for many governments of the hemisphere. It is the story that the Latin American peoples have been writing to this date, in their struggle for sovereignty. The Series is a tool for that struggle, and it is also a homage to those who have fallen.\n\n\nA Cuban airliner with 73 passengers on board left Venezuela on October 6, 1976. Two explosions took it down over the ocean, near the Barbados coast. There were no survivors.\n\nAs a result of this attack, the existence of a terrorist network was exposed to the public opinion. A network that was financed and controlled by the CIA, and which had been operating clandestinely since the 1960s. It had an important center of operations in Venezuela, where Posada Carriles was a key figure.\n\nThis documentary tells the story of terrorist Posada Carriles, since he started working for the CIA in the 1960s, until he was welcomed in Miami by the Bush Government in 2007. It reveals the tentacles of terrorism Made in the USA.\n\n\n90 minutes\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18148ba90ffb4fcc10f5690941078bc40852dbf6","amp;dn":"TERRORISM_MADE_IN_USA+Posada+Carriles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18148ba90ffb4fcc10f5690941078bc40852dbf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,20,139,169,15,251,79,204,16,245,105,9,65,7,139,196,8,82,219,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
