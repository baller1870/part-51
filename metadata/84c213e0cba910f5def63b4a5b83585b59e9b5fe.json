The fight scenes and comedy are top-notch. \n\nAvg. Rating:  \n  3.9 / 5 (based on 4 ratings). What did you think of it?  \nPlot: Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker star as cops with nothing in common who are brought together by the FBI to solve a kidnapping case. Tucker is hilarious, and the stunts are wonderfully inventive. \n \nOverview: Chan plays Lee, a Hong Kong detective who comes to Los Angeles when a Chinese diplomat&amp;#039;s 11-year old daughter is kidnapped by Lee&amp;#039;s old nemesis. The FBI guys don&amp;#039;t want this foreigner mucking up their case, so they saddle Lee with LAPD officer James Carter (Chris Tucker), a loose cannon reluctant to be partnered up. Naturally, the uninventive plotting takes a backseat to the culture-clash hijinks. Lee shows Carter some high-flying moves in exchange for some instruction in simple ebonics. \n \nCast: Jackie Chan  ||  Chris Tucker  ||  Tom Wilkinson  ||  Chris Penn  ||  Elizabeth Pena  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.542351/qx/details.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.542351/qx/details.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n_________________\nDo not break the share chain!
