The album began with Rice is Nice, the most saccharine track the band ever cut, one almost too syrupy to bear. Shoeshine Boy, Rainbow Tree, and Blueberry Blue all had childish lyrics, however the instrumentation and the mixing made them enjoyable lightweight psychedelic orchestral pop. Ask Me If I Care was catchy folk/rock, and could have been the Pipers&amp;#039; follow up to Green Tambourine, another highlight to the album. Through With You had the whole band tackling improvisational jamming, featuring a 7 minute instrumental section. Improvisational jamming would be explored further on Jungle Marmalade, the next album. This album is recommended, because it has enough lightweight songs to appeal to &quot;bubblegum&quot; listeners, yet also contains enough psychedelic, folk, and hard rock to appeal to a more contemporary audience.\n\n256 KBit/s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a34ed705f585cec94e186a10a109b4a16b31e50","amp;dn":"The+Lemon+Pipers+-+Green+Tambourine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a34ed705f585cec94e186a10a109b4a16b31e50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,52,237,112,95,88,92,236,148,225,134,161,10,16,155,74,22,179,30,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
