DC++ runs best on Windows NT based operating systems. If you run Windows 95, 98, or ME, your experience may not be the same. If you have experience in C++ programming, the source code for DC++ is also available. Although DC++ is free, the tools for compiling it are not. You will need to purchase Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 in order to compile it. DC++ is distributed in English, but it comes with the ability to download a language file that translates DC++ into their own language. The &quot;language file&quot; link below hosts many such translations. Once the language file is downloaded, DC++ must be configured to use it though Settings ? Appearance ? Language File.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79ee894ac202a70d43c83363b7bbc8dc3b2d5a26","amp;dn":"DCPlusPlus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79ee894ac202a70d43c83363b7bbc8dc3b2d5a26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,238,137,74,194,2,167,13,67,200,51,99,183,187,200,220,59,45,90,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
