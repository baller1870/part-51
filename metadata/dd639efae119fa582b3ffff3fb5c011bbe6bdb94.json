Now the regime&amp;#039;s \nobsession with keeping accurate records of its own crimes can help \nput together the case against the deposed dictator at his trial in \nBaghdad. As well as collecting written documentation, Dr Ihsan is \ntrying to locate the mass graves to use as evidence of Saddam&amp;#039;s \ncrimes. The driving force behind his quest is the grieving relatives\nand surviving members of the Barzani clan and the search is \nauthorised by Masoud Barzani, clan leader and now president of the \nKurdish region of Iraq.\n\nIn spite of the dangers of the expedition, the lack of cooperation\nfrom the Sunni locals and the frustration of a fruitless search, \nfive months later the mass graves are finally located. \n\n____________________________________________________________Encoding__\n\nFile Name....: Saddams Road To Hell (2006-TVRip-d0x).avi\nFile Size....: 399 MB (or 409,286 KB or 419,108,864 bytes)\nFrames.......: 624x352 (1.77:1) [=39:22] @ 0.193 bits/pixel\nVideo Codec..: XviD @ 1060 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: MP3 @ 128 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) CBR \n_________________________________________________________________d0x__\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd639efae119fa582b3ffff3fb5c011bbe6bdb94","amp;dn":"Saddam%5C%27s+Road+To+Hell+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd639efae119fa582b3ffff3fb5c011bbe6bdb94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,99,158,250,225,25,250,88,43,63,255,243,251,92,1,27,190,107,219,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
