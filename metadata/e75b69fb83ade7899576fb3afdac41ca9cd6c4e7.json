A bookish little man whose passion is the printed page but who is conspired against by a bank president and a wife and a world full of tongue-cluckers and the unrelenting hands of a clock. But in just a moment Mr. Bemis will enter a world without bank presidents or wives or clocks or anything else. He&amp;#039;ll have a world all to himself, without anyone. ÃƒÂ¢?? \n\nAs Bemis&amp;#039;s day progresses, it turns out both his wife and his boss think reading is a waste of time. At one point, his wife, as a cruel joke, asks Henry to read her poetry from a book. He eagerly obliges, but when he opens the book he finds that she has blacked out all the pages.\n\nThe following day, Henry takes his lunch break in the bank&amp;#039;s vault. As he reads the newspaper, he notices the foreboding headline: &quot;H-Bomb Capable of Total Destruction&quot;. Loud explosions can be heard from outside, violently shaking the vault and knocking Bemis unconscious. In the aftermath of the apparent war, he regains consciousness and emerges to find he is the last person alive on Earth. As he wanders through his town he sees devastation everywhere.\n\n\nMP4 Format for your IPOD\n\nPLEASE SEED! \n\nEnjoy! \n\nAntil0ck, \n\n_______       ______________________      ______  \n___    |________  /___(_)__  /_  __ \\________  /__\n__  /| |_  __ \\  __/_  /__  /_  / / /  ___/_  //_/\n_  ___ |  / / / /_ _  / _  / / /_/ // /__ _  ,&lt;   \n/_/  |_/_/ /_/\\__/ /_/  /_/  \\____/ \\___/ /_/|_| ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e75b69fb83ade7899576fb3afdac41ca9cd6c4e7","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+Episode+8-+Time+Enough+at+last","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e75b69fb83ade7899576fb3afdac41ca9cd6c4e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,91,105,251,131,173,231,137,149,118,251,58,253,172,65,202,156,214,196,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
