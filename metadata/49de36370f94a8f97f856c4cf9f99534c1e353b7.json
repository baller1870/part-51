Is Madonna really our mum of the year? Are you bored of millionaire rock stars moaning about how depressed they are about their lives ? or are you fed up seeing photos of drunken reality stars falling out of nightclubs, flashing their unmentionables? If so, check out our celebrity Shame Academy of stars. These are the 75 celebrities who have set our teeth on edge, heaped ridicule upon themselves and kept our newspapers full of their gurning faces for the past twelve months.\n\nAn alternative review of 2006, the show also takes a swipe at the most annoying products, pop songs and pop culture disasters to have got up our noses in the last twelve months - including everything from the annum&amp;#039;s most annoying fads to the most shocking celebrity fashion frock-ups.\n\n\tShow One\nWe start the rundown with &amp;#039;favourites&amp;#039; like from Jan Leeming and Paul Burrell, Tom and Katie and Kate Moss. These are the famous faces who have had you reaching for the remote and hurling the gossip mags out the window. They?ve sold their stories, proclaimed their love, got divorced, got plastered, danced, sung, bitched and pouted their way into your bad books. So now, before 2006 is out, it?s time to name, shame and celebrate them. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49de36370f94a8f97f856c4cf9f99534c1e353b7","amp;dn":"The.Most.Annoying.People.Of.2006.WS.PDTV.XviD-FTP-CD1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49de36370f94a8f97f856c4cf9f99534c1e353b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,222,54,55,15,148,168,249,127,133,108,76,249,249,149,52,193,227,83,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
