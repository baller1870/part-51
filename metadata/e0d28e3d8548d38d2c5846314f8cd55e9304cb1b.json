Repeat, this is the Alpha Tech Release.  This is not a final version of the game and is incomplete, and thus has many bugs.  The game is still very fun, and addictive once you get past the bugs.\n\nThe official 2845 website can be found at http://www.clancoregames.com/\n\nQuick Description: This game has giant robots fighting each other, a basic fighter/bomber to fly around in, and infantry units.\n  \nFor more detail go to the above website, and be sure you look through the starsiege 2845 discussion in the forums before playing.  It will help with the game\\&amp;#039;s performance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0d28e3d8548d38d2c5846314f8cd55e9304cb1b","amp;dn":"Starsiege+2845+ATR+Installer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0d28e3d8548d38d2c5846314f8cd55e9304cb1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,210,142,61,133,72,211,141,44,88,70,49,79,140,213,94,147,4,203,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
