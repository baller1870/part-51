Dead. The novel opens atmospherically in a frigid church graveyard as Tempe labors to exhume the century-old remains of a nun so that the Church can posthumously declare her a saint. But the bones aren\\&amp;#039;t where they\\&amp;#039;re supposed to be according to the graveyard map, and there\\&amp;#039;s something suspicious about them when they do turn up. Tempe\\&amp;#039;s caseload multiplies as a house fire proves to be a horrific instance of arson and a university teaching assistant who\\&amp;#039;s recently joined a cult goes missing. The three seemingly individual events begin to braid together, as the doings with the doomsday cult draw Tempe to North Carolina. As in D?j? Dead, ReichsAherself a forensic anthropologistArenders comprehensively and believably the cool, tense intelligence of her heroine. A North Carolina native who consults in Montreal only a few months of the year, Tempe still hasn\\&amp;#039;t acclimated to the bone-chilling Northern cold, and if she\\&amp;#039;s come to expect the misogynist attitudes of some of the Canadian officials, she still bristles at them. Also well presented are Tempe\\&amp;#039;s refreshing compassion in the face of relentless autopsies, her ability to describe a corpse with judiciously graphic detail and her penchant for revealing the art behind the science on such matters as the preservation of a corpse\\&amp;#039;s teeth. Reichs\\&amp;#039;s first novel, which won the Arthur Ellis Award for Best First Novel of 1997, was compared justifiably to the Kay Scarpetta novels of Patricia Cornwell. Soon, Cornwell\\&amp;#039;s novels may be compared to Reichs\\&amp;#039;s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fbe5c7d4baf0e636cfdba9ff98eec75acd395d7","amp;dn":"Kathy+Reichs+-+Death+Du+Jour","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fbe5c7d4baf0e636cfdba9ff98eec75acd395d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,190,92,125,75,175,14,99,108,253,186,159,249,142,236,117,172,211,149,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
