Liberally laced with interviews with folks like Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein and Michael Moore, it also includes insightful commentary from a (small) handful of liberated corporate executives.\n\nThe sum total is a compelling story of the evil that can be and is done by and in the name of corporations. I say this as one who has worked in a corporate environment my entire career, and who for a very long time has had difficulty getting past the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;but these are almost all nice people -- I don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;t know any ogres out to intentionally rape &amp; pillage\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039; perspective.\n\nWhat I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;m gradually wakening to is the realization that yes, the corporate structure is very efficient at doing what it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s designed to do -- which unfortunately does not include taking social responsibility or the greater good into account. Instead it\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s ruthlessly focused on the bottom line, come hell (literally) or high water -- or polluted water.\n\nI highly recommend this film. I know I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;ll be going back for a second viewing -- there\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s that much content, that I know I didn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;t absorb it all the first time around. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c66f60294a3525902ab85ced726266d20834850d","amp;dn":"The+Corporation+-Please+Seed+2%2B+Copies+-+xvid+-+32x240+-+9-20-07","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c66f60294a3525902ab85ced726266d20834850d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,111,96,41,74,53,37,144,42,184,92,237,114,98,102,210,8,52,133,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
