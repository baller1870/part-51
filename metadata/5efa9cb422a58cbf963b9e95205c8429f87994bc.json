Scratch tells the story of the music with the help of some of the most important scratch pioneers of the last 20 years, such as Babu (of Dilated Peoples and Beat Junkies), DJ Q-Bert and Afrika Bambaataa amongst others. These interviews give us an incite about how the music was born and its growth. We also get helpful tips on the art of scratching from Q-Bert and Mix Master Mike (from The Beastie Boys).\n\n\nSource......: DVD\nOutput......: DVD-R *PAL\nRls Date....: 2001\nGenre.......: Documentary\nIMDB Rating.: 7.8/10 (780 votes)\n\nDVD FEATURES\n\nAUDIO           - English 5.1\nSUBTITLES       - Romanian \nASPECT RATIO    - 1.78:1\nVIDEO           - Untouched\nMENU            - Untouched\nDVD EXTRAS      - Scene selection\n\nEnjoy this relese!\n\n\nbOgz from Transylvania","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5efa9cb422a58cbf963b9e95205c8429f87994bc","amp;dn":"Scratch+-+2001+-+by+bOgz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5efa9cb422a58cbf963b9e95205c8429f87994bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,250,156,180,34,165,140,191,150,59,158,149,32,92,132,41,248,121,148,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
