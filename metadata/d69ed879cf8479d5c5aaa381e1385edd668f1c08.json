Only a 20 minute version/clips have been circulating. Here ... as of now this failure of access ends. Bill Moyers, the respected TV journalist, analyzes the threats to constitutional government posed by an illegitimate network [Read: Cheney and crew] operating from within the government but using secrecy to set itself up outside of the government / peoples oversight. All this back in 1987. This documentary gives a fascinating overview of what has actually happened in the last 50 years regarding the CIA and the Cold War (including Iran, Guatamala, Cuba, Vietnam and Chile). The foundation for the massive push towards greater secrecy in government going on today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d69ed879cf8479d5c5aaa381e1385edd668f1c08","amp;dn":"Bill+Moyers%3A+The+Secret+Government+PBS+%281987%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d69ed879cf8479d5c5aaa381e1385edd668f1c08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,158,216,121,207,132,121,213,197,170,163,129,225,56,94,221,102,143,28,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
