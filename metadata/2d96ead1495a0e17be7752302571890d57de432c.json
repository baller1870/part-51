When it comes to love, Charlie MacKenzie has had his share of bad luck: Sherri was a klepto - Charlie still can&amp;#039;t find his cat. Jill was unemployed - but Charlie knew she really worked for the mafia. Pam smelled like soup - beef vegetable soup. Good thing for Charlie these shortcomings became apparent, if only to him. Good thing for Charlie he discovered the truth before things went too far - before he stumbled into MARRIAGE! Because to Charlie the &quot;M&quot; word is just one step away from the fate foretold in that chilling phrase: &quot;Til Death us do part.&quot; When Charlie meets Harriet Michaels everything changes. Harriets not like the others. She&amp;#039;s smart, sexy, and crazy about Charlie. This time Charlie is determined to overcome the fears that sabotaged his past relationships. This time, he&amp;#039;s ready for some commitment. Sure, Harriet may have her shortcomings - but so what? After all those other women, what&amp;#039;s the worst she could be? An axe murderer?\n\nStarring:\n\nMike Myers, Nancy Travis, Anthony La Paglia and Amanda Plummer.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nPlease Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d96ead1495a0e17be7752302571890d57de432c","amp;dn":"So.I.Married.A.Axe.Murderer%5BEng%5DDvdrip.Dino.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d96ead1495a0e17be7752302571890d57de432c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,150,234,209,73,90,14,23,190,119,82,48,37,113,137,13,87,222,67,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
