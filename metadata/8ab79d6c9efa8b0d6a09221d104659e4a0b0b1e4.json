This is a\ncountry unique in failing all five crucial tests by which the UN\nmeasures human rights, yet until now the world has all but ignored.\nFinally, the UN Security Council is beginning to debate how to deal\nwith this renegade nation, in which Britain is the second biggest\ninvestor.\n\nJournalist Evan Williams goes undercover for Dispatches deep inside\nBurma on a highly dangerous journey to witness new levels of violence\nby the regime against its own people.  Evan documents atrocities\ncommitted against the Karen people, and follows up by illegally\nentering Burma again - this time as a tourist.  He meets dissidents\nwilling to sacrifice their freedom so that people on the outside\nshould know what is going on.  Despite Aung San Suu Kyi?s plea for\nan end to foreign investment in Burma, Evan discovers that - thanks\nto the tax loophole of a British Protectorate - Britain remains the\nsecond biggest investor in this systematically brutal dictatorship.  \n\n____________________________________________________________Encoding__\n\nFile Name....: Burma&amp;#039;s Secret War (2006-TVRip-d0x).avi\nFile Size....: 449 MB (or 460,156 KB or 471,199,744 bytes)\nFrames.......: 576x432 (1.33:1) [=4:3] @ 0.208 bits/pixel\nVideo Codec..: XviD @ 1294 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: MP3 @ 128 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) CBR\n_________________________________________________________________d0x__ ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ab79d6c9efa8b0d6a09221d104659e4a0b0b1e4","amp;dn":"Burma%5C%27s+Secret+War+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ab79d6c9efa8b0d6a09221d104659e4a0b0b1e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,183,157,108,158,250,139,13,106,9,34,29,16,70,89,228,160,176,177,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
