Butch rips off a runner for local drug dealer, Tank, and is soon right back into his old habits of snorting coke and shooting up heroin with his best friend Lester. Enraged by Butch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s affront and already determined to get revenge on him for a past wrong, Tank sets about getting even with his old enemy by hiring a hulking brute, Gates to beat Butch. When the confrontation occurs, however, Gates breaks his hand on the battle-hardened Butch. Besides Lester, the only people in Butch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s corner are his two brothers, the mentally-unhinged Vietnam War veteran Louis and aspiring artist Ruby, neither of whom can be counted on to help him in the inevitable showdown.\n\nRuntime:  USA:100 min (unrated version) / USA:96 min / Argentina:98 min\n Audio:  MP3, 2 channel(s), 128kbits\nVideo:  704 x 516, Divx5/6,\nFile Size:  979 mbs\nFilm Rating:\nSince the beliefs that parents want to instill in their children can vary greatly, we ask that instead of adding your personal opinions about what is right or wrong in a film, that you instead use this new feature to help parents make informed viewing decisions by describing the facts of relevant scenes in the title for each one of the different categories: Sex and Nudity, Violence and Gore, Profanity, Alcohol/Drugs/Smoking, and Frightening/Intense Scenes . \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115781/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115781/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d7360e0f6d75c96fe4649116f457b87477c65fa","amp;dn":"Bullet.Tupac.M.rourke.DVD_shrunk%28divx.%291996.divx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d7360e0f6d75c96fe4649116f457b87477c65fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,115,96,224,246,215,92,150,254,70,73,17,111,69,123,135,71,124,101,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
