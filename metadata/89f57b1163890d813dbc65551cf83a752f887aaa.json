Advancements? I do not know wether I would call this an advancement or improvement over the original. In my opinion the color scheme of the original was never really taken to use properly, creating a relatively fainted colour on occasion. I believe that as far as the colour scheme goes, this edit is superior. However, I am something of a b&amp;w fan anyhow, so I suppose that doesnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t matter much. You decide for yourself is this worse or better than the original.\n\nwww.fanedit.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89f57b1163890d813dbc65551cf83a752f887aaa","amp;dn":"The+Crow%3A+De-Colorized+by+Messenjah14","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89f57b1163890d813dbc65551cf83a752f887aaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,245,123,17,99,137,13,129,61,188,101,85,28,248,58,117,47,136,122,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
