Organized for the relief of refugees in East Pakistan (now independent Bangladesh), the event was the first benefit concert of this magnitude in world history. It featured an all-star supergroup of performers that included Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr, Billy Preston and Leon Russell.\n\nAn album was released later in 1971 and a concert film was released in 1972, with later releases for home video. In 2005, the film was re-issued on DVD accompanied by a new documentary.\n\n\nNote: This is not a DVDrip, this is probaly a copy from VHS. However it&amp;#039;s pretty watchable. The sound is a little bit out of sincronization but it&amp;#039;s fine.
