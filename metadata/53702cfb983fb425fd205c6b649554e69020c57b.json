The Shinigami are litterally &quot;Death gods&quot; (which are invisible to human eyes) that sometimes &quot;runs around&quot; in the real world helping poore souls, otherwise known as ghosts, to the &quot;other side&quot; (in this case Soul Society) By doing this the Shinigami are maintaining the balance between the dead, that are leaving the world (the souls that I mentioned erlier), and  the ones that are being born (the ones coming in). However, if a soul wanders for too long in the real world, the anguish that they bare, problably because some of them have some kind of unfinished buiseness or bare some kind of a gruge, sometimes turns them in to a scary looking creature called a &quot;Hollow&quot;. Once a soul turnes in to a Hollow they can&amp;#039;t be converted back and must therefore be killed. So one night the main character, Kurosaki Ichigo, finds himself in the middle of a fight between a young female Shinigami called Kuchiki Rukia and a fat-ass Hollow which are trying to &quot;eat&quot; one or all of Ichigos famiy members (I can&amp;#039;t remember all the details) because they have an unusually high Reatsu (Spirit energy), and accidentally absorbs Rukias Shinigami powers.\n\nThats the basics of the story but it gets A LOT better later down the road. \n\n\n\nGenrÃƒÂ©: Sci-fi/Samurai/Adventure/Fantasy\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53702cfb983fb425fd205c6b649554e69020c57b","amp;dn":"Bleach+Ep31-40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53702cfb983fb425fd205c6b649554e69020c57b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,112,44,251,152,63,180,37,253,32,92,107,100,149,84,230,144,32,197,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
