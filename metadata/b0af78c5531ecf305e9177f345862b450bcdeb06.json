In fact, Carlin and his \\&quot;Seven Dirty Words\\&quot; \ncomedy routine were central to the 1978 U.S. Supreme Court case F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation, \nin which a narrow 5-4 decision by the justices affirmed the government\\&amp;#039;s right to regulate Carlin\\&amp;#039;s act on the public airwaves.\n\nGeorge Carlin\\&amp;#039;s most recent stand up routines are primarily focused on attacking the flaws in modern-day America. \nHe often takes on contemporary political issues in the United States and satirizes the excesses of American culture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0af78c5531ecf305e9177f345862b450bcdeb06","amp;dn":"George+Carlin+1-+There+is+no+god++2-+Religion+%28mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0af78c5531ecf305e9177f345862b450bcdeb06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,175,120,197,83,30,207,48,94,145,119,243,69,134,43,69,11,205,235,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
