Aliens have been among us since the 1940\\&amp;#039;s, but a government cover-up has prevented the public from knowing this. As the series progresses, we follow John Loengard and Kim Sayers as they attempt to thwart numerous plans of the alien Hive, most of which are tied to historical events and figures. In addition, the pair must stay one step ahead of a covert government agency, Majestic-12, tasked with fighting the aliens while maintaining the conspiracy of silence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11e67b9de8e7bc257a26d3d139efd56a4114bba3","amp;dn":"Dark+Skies+%28VHS-mp4%29+Swesub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11e67b9de8e7bc257a26d3d139efd56a4114bba3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,230,123,157,232,231,188,37,122,38,211,209,57,239,213,106,65,20,187,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
