So I started making my 1hour and a half music experience.\nI like various kinds of music and like to hear them intermixed. That is a risk no radio station takes and also not many djs in the world. \nTill now only Paul Oakenfold , Daniel Davoli and a few more \nhave managed to marry many kinds and ages of music together.\n\nAnyways, hope you enjoy this mixed disks as much as I do.\nRemember that I am not professional, I do this as a hobby.\nThe date after MIXAMIX is the date I have started creating each of this cds. \nThe creation may take from just one day to many months.\n\nA few words about MIXAMIX 20070512\n\n\tBy the first moment I started making this mix I had this Summer in my mind.\nSummer clubbing here in Greece means strong beats and balaeric sounds together.\nAlso year by year some tracks remain the same like they were writen for every Summer \nin our life.\nSo in this mix you will hear new tracks from Mika, Tiga, Global Deejays, Eric Prydz and more\nmixed together with some all time classics and break beat sounds.\nAlso here u will hear some of the best remixes by Mikro.\nMikro is probably the most famous Elecro group in Greece. Have a look at the site: http://www.mikro.gr\nand listen to their tracks. Keep an eye for their new album &quot;Restart&quot; coming out by the end of June.\nFor this mix I wont use the magic wand since there is no real remix to any track by me. However most tracks \nare intermixed in a way that gives a new sound to each of them. \n\nAccording to my friends this is one of my best mixes so I hope u will enjoy it also. \n\nYou will need to overburn 1min and 3sec for this mix. \n\n\tKeep sharing music and have fun!\n\n  \n26 tracks in playlist, average track length: 3:07\nPlaylist length: 1 hour 21 minutes 3 seconds\n\n    Playlist files:\n\n          1.
