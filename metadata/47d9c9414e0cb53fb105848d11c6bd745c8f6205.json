In the end, Petter felt that he was not \nmotivated enough to continue with the band, and decided to quit. \nIngnis was once again without a vocalist, and turned to David Olgarsson, \nwho had gone to the same school as Ragnar and also played in the same \nband for a short while.\n\nAfter some more gigs with the new line-up, they went in and recorded their first demo, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;42\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; in may 2004. Even though it felt like an impressive feat at the time, the novelty of having a recorded demo quickly faded away, and was replaced by an itch to record a new and better representation of their sound.\n\nSo, during may/june 2005, a couple of gigs richer, a hell of a lot better, \nand maybe not too much wiser, they went ahead and recorded a new demo at Centrumvillan, Granloholm/Oscars Sommarstuga, respectively, and got a whoppingly better sound than on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;42\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;.\n\n\nAt the moment, they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;re looking for more gigs and new places/venues to play,\nand the new demo, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Restaurantica Prefect\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; is out to the masses.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47d9c9414e0cb53fb105848d11c6bd745c8f6205","amp;dn":"ingnis+all+songs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47d9c9414e0cb53fb105848d11c6bd745c8f6205","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,217,201,65,78,12,181,63,177,5,132,141,17,198,189,116,92,143,98,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
