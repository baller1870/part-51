Hopefully I\\&amp;#039;ve done everything right. This torrent is for Pclinuxos Big Daddy p.93a. I\\&amp;#039;m posting it here because the official mirror seems to be slow and I did not see a full unedited version hosted here.\n\nThis file is exactly as it was when it came off of their server. It\\&amp;#039;s a very complete version of Linux that has excellent hardware detection. I have tried it on 2 of my computers (a laptop and a desktop) and have not ran across a single piece of hardware that did not work right out of the box. \n\nIt runs as a live cd and you can install from the same cd if you wish. It\\&amp;#039;s really simple to use and great for windows users that may want to try to figure out what Linux is all about. \n\nAnyway it\\&amp;#039;s here if anyone wants it. Have fun with it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe270ec9e8c8c26d493ef2cf0943a14293cb1885","amp;dn":"Pclinuxos+Big+Daddy+p.93a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe270ec9e8c8c26d493ef2cf0943a14293cb1885","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,39,14,201,232,200,194,109,73,62,242,207,9,67,161,66,147,203,24,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
