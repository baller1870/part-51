Nevertheless, terrorist attacks that are believed to be \nlinked to the international terrorist organization Al-Qaeda continue to be \nperpetrated around the world. And behind the violence, Al-Qaeda is attacking \nits perceived enemies in another, lesser-known way: through the media. \n\nResearch conducted by NHK in various locations recently yielded a glimpse of \nal-Qaeda\\&amp;#039;s media war. A secretive al-Qaeda media group known as As-Sahaab \nproduces propaganda videos on an ongoing basis using advanced computer graphics \nand video processing techniques and distributes them on video CDs and via the \nInternet for viewing by Muslims all over the world. At the same time, \nAs-Sahaab skillfully manipulates a satellite television station in the Middle \nEast as a way of using the airwaves to spread messages intended to justify \nterrorism in the eyes of the world. Al-Qaeda?s media output is believed to \ninspire yet more terrorist acts. The United States government is devoting huge \nfinancial resources to countering al-Qaeda?s propaganda but has yet to achieve \nmajor success. \n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: 050722.cbc.media.jihad.640x480.xvid.mp3.festering.leper.avi\nFilesize.....: 688 MB (or 705,284 KB or 722,210,816 bytes)\nRuntime......: 00:44:56 (80,804 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 2006 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID\\&amp;#039;d as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 127 kb/s (63/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.90.\u0002?\nFrame Size...: 640x480 (1.33:1) [=4:3]\nLanguage.....: English\n\nQPel/GMC.....: No\n\n\ned2k://|file|050722.cbc.media.jihad.640x480.xvid.mp3.festering.leper.avi|722210816|9BDFCA9F3116E734D27B1E30AA6F7F01|/\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6616f956cc14d0f9bf20369b4f56e434189afd9","amp;dn":"Media+Jihad+%282005%29+CBC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6616f956cc14d0f9bf20369b4f56e434189afd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,97,111,149,108,193,77,15,155,242,3,105,180,245,110,67,65,137,175,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
