He depends on the dreams of those in Springwood to fuel his existence. But when the town covers up his existence in an attempt to make people forget, Freddy is left powerless. In a last ditch effort he springs Jason Voorhees from his own personal Hell and sends him to Elm Street, determined to strike fear in the hearts of Springwood teens. But when Jason won&amp;#039;t stop killing Freddy&amp;#039;s &quot;children,&quot; Krueger decides it&amp;#039;s time to take Voorhees out. Caught in the cross-fire are Lori and Will, both of whom feature a history with Freddy.\n\n\nDont forget 2 SEED!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a0ef9cfd84a968659a3e293bcb4d614962eaf24","amp;dn":"A+Nightmare+On+Elm+Street+8-Freddy+Vs+Jason-JESS.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a0ef9cfd84a968659a3e293bcb4d614962eaf24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,14,249,207,216,74,150,134,89,163,226,147,188,180,214,20,150,46,175,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
