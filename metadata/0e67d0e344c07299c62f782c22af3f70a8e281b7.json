Yeah, play Nintendo without dealing with carts and other problems with ancient hardware.  Some people complain that this isn&amp;#039;t &quot;pure,&quot; because it&amp;#039;s not the original hardware.  Let me tell you, spend one hour playing with this and you&amp;#039;ll forget all about that.  \n\nThis is an image of a self-booting NesterDC 6 disc, for which I made my own menu screens.  I think this has all the games you could want (except RPGs cause I don&amp;#039;t play those :P )  I played every god damn stupid ROM I could find and kept only the playable ones.\n\n330 ROMs, list in my older post here: http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3963679/Nintendo_for_Dreamcast____emulator\nI decided to compress the image for much faster goodness!  This is less than half the size of the previous download.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e67d0e344c07299c62f782c22af3f70a8e281b7","amp;dn":"Nintendo+emulator+for+Dreamcast","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e67d0e344c07299c62f782c22af3f70a8e281b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,103,208,227,68,192,114,153,198,47,120,44,34,175,63,112,168,226,129,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
