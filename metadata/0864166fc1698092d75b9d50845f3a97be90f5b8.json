Though the band spawned many further hits across the rest of the world, \\&quot;Take on Me\\&quot; exploded in the States and the group never cracked the top of the charts again. It\\'s a shame, because the album contains a handful of songs that nearly match the manic energy and emotional crack of its big hit. Further, it\\'s a cohesive album with smart pace changeups, and it rarely fails to delight or satisfy a listener\\'s need for a synth pop fix.\n\n128 kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0864166fc1698092d75b9d50845f3a97be90f5b8","amp;dn":"A-Ha+-+Hunting+High+and+Low+-+1985","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0864166fc1698092d75b9d50845f3a97be90f5b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,100,22,111,193,105,128,146,215,91,157,80,132,95,58,151,190,144,245,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
