Enterprise. En route to the distant Farpoint Station, the Enterprise is captured by a capricious, omnipotent being who calls himself Q. In a court of his own devising, Q judges that, based on its past, humanity is unfit to exist. Picard argues that the human race has outgrown its infancy, and should be judged on its current actions. Q relents, and agrees to monitor the Enterprises new crew as it investigates a mysterious force at Farpoint Station.\n\nEPISODES\n1 - Datalore\n2 - Angel One\n3 - 11001001\n4 - Too Short a Season\n\nRelease Date : 09/10/2007\nOrignal DVD Release Date : 28/3/2002\nGENRE : SCI-FI\nRUN TIME : 40 min/episode\nIMDb : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092455\nIMAGE : ISO\nVIDEO : CCE 4 PASS\nSCREEN : Fullscreen (4:3) NTSC\nSEASON : 1\nDISC # : 4\nTOTAL DISCS OF THE SEASON : 7\n\nAUDIO LANGUAGES:\n- ENGLISH\n- PORTUGUESE (BR)\n\nSUBTITLES\n- ENGLISH\n- PORTUGUESE (BR)\n- SPANISH\n\n\nENJOY!\nI WOULD LIKE TO BE THANKFUL IMMENSELY TO ADNUS.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2539a91ee57d55497fd07bbe52c11acf295a071","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+-+The+Next+Generation+-+Season+1+Disc+3+-+DVDR+-+En%2CSp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2539a91ee57d55497fd07bbe52c11acf295a071","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,83,154,145,238,87,213,84,151,253,7,187,229,44,17,172,242,149,160,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
