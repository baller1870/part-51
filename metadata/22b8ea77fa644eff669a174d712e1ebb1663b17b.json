The film proceeds from an exclusive interview with Steven Jones, a professor of physics at Brigham Young University. Jones argues that the mechanism of the building collapses proposed by US government investigators is extremely unlikely, hence the title of the film. His influential research paper is entitled &quot;Why Indeed did the WTC Towers Collapse?&quot; ALSO FEATURED: Jim Hoffman pioneered research in the hypothesis that the WTC buildings were demolished, as the creator of three meticulous and sprawling sites, wtc7.net, 911review.com and 911research.wtc7.net. With Don Paul, who also appears briefly in the film, Hoffman is the co-author of Waking Up from Our Nightmare: The 9/11/01 Crimes in New York City. Professor David Ray Griffin is the author of The New Pearl Harbor and Omissions and Distortions: The 9/11 Commission. Griffin spoke to standing-room only crowds in New York last October on &quot;The Destruction of the World Trade Center.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22b8ea77fa644eff669a174d712e1ebb1663b17b","amp;dn":"Improbable.Collapse%282006%29DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22b8ea77fa644eff669a174d712e1ebb1663b17b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,184,234,119,250,100,78,255,102,154,23,77,113,46,30,187,22,99,177,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
