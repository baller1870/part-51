I&amp;#039;ve included a text file with the conents of this CD so you can have a scan through at what is included without booting it up on an Amiga, the formatting is a bit rough but I&amp;#039;m sure you&amp;#039;ll cope! \n\nThe main benefit of this CD over the previous two is that it includes a search engine not only for the titles held on this CD but also for the previous two, so boot from this CD and you can then search and extract titles from the previous two CD&amp;#039;s (as long as you have the other CDs!).\n\nI was able to burn these images onto CD using an NEC burner and could read it both in Windows and on my A500+ with A570.\n\nIf this is popular then I&amp;#039;ll post the next 2 CDs in the series which feature increasingly more AGA stuff, so remember to leave comments if you want more :)\n\nThe first two CDs can be found here: http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3907988/Amiga_PD_CDs_-_17_Bit_Collection_A_amp_B","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78d8f2897234ce230845109aa1900ea2924b7ae4","amp;dn":"Amiga+PD+CD+-+17-Bit+-+The+Continuation+Disc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78d8f2897234ce230845109aa1900ea2924b7ae4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,216,242,137,114,52,206,35,8,69,16,154,161,144,14,162,146,75,122,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
