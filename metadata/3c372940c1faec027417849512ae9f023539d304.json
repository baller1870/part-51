Three hours of Crust, Grind, Power Violence, Thrash, H/C, Black Metal, NWOBHM, Crossover, Folk, and Punk Rock\n\nThis week I\\&amp;#039;ll be playing:\nFuck The Facts-Female fronted grind from ottawa\nEast west Blast test-Chris from Spazz, and dave from Municipal waste team up and sound like the Residents(weird)\nMind Of Asian-Japanese Fastcore\nCyness-German Grind demons\nDick Cheney/B.U.S.H-Furious fast Punk from the split ep\nReencarnacion-Punk as fuck Colombian Black Metal from 1988\n\nAlso inh my album spotlight tonight I\\&amp;#039;ll be playing the 1979 Wreckless Eric album \\&quot;Whole Wide World\\&quot;.\n\nActually it\\&amp;#039;s not a proper album at all but a combination of tracks from his first two albums. I picked up a copy of this at \\&quot;Noise annoys\\&quot; in Toronto this past summer, because I\\&amp;#039;ve been semi obsessed with the tile track for years.\nI first heard it by German punkers Die Toten Hosen(joined by Eric himself) on their cover album \\&quot;Learning English\\&quot;.\nThe song stands out as one of the best Pop Punk songs ever written.\nWhen I saw the record I had to have it, and the whole thing holds together really well.\nEric was one of the original Stiff records guys(Along with Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe, and Ian Dury), and released three records with them between 78-80. He writes catchy little pop songs, but his sneering vocal delivery gives them a rough edge.\nHe\\&amp;#039;s criminally under rated, and is just waiting for rediscovery.\nIf you like the Power Pop end of the Punk spectrum (think Buzzcocks, or early Joe Jackson) you should definitely check this shit out.\nApparently the song Whole Wide World is featured in the new movie \\&quot;Stranger than fiction\\&quot;, so a revival might be just around the corner.\n\nHere\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s this weeks full playlist.\n\nThe Hammerheads-Everybody gets laid tonight\nLittle Nell-Do the swim\nMetalucifer-Flight of iron pegasus\nZnowhite-To the last breath\nReencarnacion-Reencarnacion (888 metal)\nMidnight-Servant of no one\nImpurity-Lucifer spewing blasphemy\nSkull Face And Others-In our veins\nLimb From Limb-Conclusion\nBallast-Fuse\nFuck The Facts-The sound of your smashed head\nFucked Up-David comes to life\nFuck On The Beach-I have never seen myself\nMind Of Asian-I feel the earth move\nEast West Blast Test-Unfantastic voyage\nDick Cheney-Fast\nB.U.S.H.-Bush war\nBrain Handle-Shit pizza\nWreckless Eric-(I\\&amp;#039;d go the)Whole wide world\nWreckless Eric-Take the cash\nWreckless Eric-Lets go to the pictures\nWreckless Eric-Walking on the surface of the moon\nWreckless Eric-Hit + miss judy\nWreckless Eric-I wish it would rain\nWreckless Eric-Reconnez cherie\nWreckless Eric-Veronica\nWreckless Eric-Brain thives\nWreckless Eric-Semaphore signals\nWreckless Eric-I need a situation\nWreckless Eric-The final taxi\nWreckless Eric-There isn\\&amp;#039;t anything else\nJohn Cooper Clarke-The new assassin\nThe Fall-Lost in music\nThe Exploding Hearts-Busy signals\nFozzy-Live wire\nDie Toten Hosen-Born to lose\nThe Germs-Lexicon devil\nVoivod-Ripping headaches\nThe Ramones-Do you remember rock\\&amp;#039;n\\&amp;#039;roll radio\nCyness-200000 losers\nAssuck-Corners\nS.O.B-Thrash night\nKamikatzi-I\\&amp;#039;m a ninja\nDog Soldiers-Crucified dove\nAssassinate-C.o.n.t.r.o.l.\nHellshock-Passage\nSon Of Jor-El-Rebellion\nFistula-For a better tomorrow\nScumchrist-Fire in the manger\nMouth Sewn Shut-Get the gun\nMargaret Thrasher-Dead to me\nHenk Bading-Dialog for man and machine\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mun.ca/chmr/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mun.ca/chmr/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTune the fuck in!!!\nTHE IRON HMST*R\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c372940c1faec027417849512ae9f023539d304","amp;dn":"Apok+Raids+Dec3rd+06+chmr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c372940c1faec027417849512ae9f023539d304","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,55,41,64,193,250,236,2,116,23,132,149,18,174,159,2,53,57,211,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
