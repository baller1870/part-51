I was going to do 3 parts however I&amp;#039;ve decided to condense the mix series down to 2 mixes with the first part focusing on the early years up to the 100th release while the second mix focused on everything else. Once again it was VERY hard to make a great mix due to the rediculous amount of quality quality tunes that are available through Moving Shadow&amp;#039;s back catalog but I believe I&amp;#039;ve been able to pull it off nicely. I&amp;#039;ve also gone and &quot;upgraded&quot; the mix itself. If you have an iPod, where you would normally see the lyrics (press the center button 1-3 times) I&amp;#039;ve included the tracklist itself so that you&amp;#039;ll be able to identify any of the songs you don&amp;#039;t recognize or forget the name of...on the go :bgrin: plus full ID3 done this time. Anyway, on to the tracklist:\n\nTracklist:\n\n1: Dom and Optical - Concrete Shoes\n2: Neotech - Valves\n3: Flytronix - Contemporary Accousticz Jam\n4: EZ Rollers - Tough At The Top (Origin Unknown Remix)\n5: Dom and Roland - Can&amp;#039;t Punish Me\n6: Deep Blue - The Helicopter Tune (Cause 4 Concern Remix)\n7: Ice Minus and Decoder - Drowning\n8: Technical Itch - Portscan\n9: Dom and Keaton - Twisted City\n10: AK1200 and Danny Breaks - Deep Porn VIP\n11: EZ Rollers - RS2000 (Full Length Vocal Mix)\n12: Robbie Rivera - Harder &amp; Faster (Weapon and E-Sassin Remix)\n13: Muffler - Cold World\n14: Matt-U and Jade - Salem\n15: Corrupt Souls - Broadcast\n16: Gein - Street Sweeper\n17: Technical Itch - Crystal\n18: Dom and Roland - Thunder (Remix)\n19: E-Sassin - Genome VIP\n20: Ice Minus - Jabba\n21: Dom &amp; Ryme Tyme - Iceburg\n22: Noisia - Cold Veins\n23: Sunchase - Next Rhythm\n24: Blame - Artificial Intelligence\n25: Calyx feat. Ill.Skillz - Thru Your Eyes\n26: Culture Shock - White Knight\n27: Future Prophecies - The Dawn\n28: Omni Trio - Thru The vibe (John B Remix)\n\nThe mix itself is 112mb, 192kb/s, and is just a tad over 1:21 long (sorry CD Crew). Enjoy the mix, as I had quite a fun time mixing it, and as ALWAYS, let me know what you think of it :twothumbs \n\nContact:    misc (at) 1217design (dot) com\n\n-Helix","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42379f29c6b09643a5f20a84fec9d778afdf79eb","amp;dn":"DJ+Helix+-+Moving+Shadow+Tribute+Mix+Part+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42379f29c6b09643a5f20a84fec9d778afdf79eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,55,159,41,198,176,150,67,165,242,10,132,254,201,215,120,175,223,121,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
