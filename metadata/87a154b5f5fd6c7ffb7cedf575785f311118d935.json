This is a mashup of Armand Van Heldens Rock Da Spot wich is the flip side to (You Dont Even Know ME) from 1999 and the acapella from the promo pressing of 20 Fingers (Short Dick Man). I think it worked out pretty well. Let me know what you think. The bass may be a little high because i havnt mastered it yet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87a154b5f5fd6c7ffb7cedf575785f311118d935","amp;dn":"Dj+Siryn+-+White+Label+-+Mashup+-+Rock+Da+Short+Dick+Man+Spot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87a154b5f5fd6c7ffb7cedf575785f311118d935","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,161,84,181,245,253,108,127,251,124,237,245,117,120,95,49,17,24,217,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
