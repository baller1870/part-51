What it accomplished was to give birth to a new culture and way of life, for American youth. What other movie has done this except Rebel Without A Cause? One of the most important movies of all time. The elements are simple yet fascinating. The story is timeless, young people try to succeed against all odds. Yet the story is always believable and never depressing. The characters are so realistic, a city dweller, would recognize them as neighbors. The story is entertaining, and comes to a satisfying ending. Buy this one for your permanent collection. It is a piece of American history.\n\n\nIll be sharing the following soon, also as DVD5\n\nWildStyle\nKrushgroove\nStyle Wars(both discs)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a96d8fd0558fd6d39003514e4bae4ae38dc86c95","amp;dn":"Beat+Street","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a96d8fd0558fd6d39003514e4bae4ae38dc86c95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,109,143,208,85,143,214,211,144,3,81,78,75,174,74,227,141,200,108,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
