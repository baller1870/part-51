Though these files are also located on your Windows installation CD (if you have one), I recommend you not delete anything located here. Deleting these files won?t recover much room, and the convenience of having the files there save a lot of time for us techie-types. (The contents of the i386 folder can commonly be found in the folder at C:\\Windows\\Options\\Cabs. This Windows &quot;cabs&quot; folder is essentially the same as the i386 folder.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09681fa8fd1d61c0395c68821ba228e108192ec3","amp;dn":"i386+directory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09681fa8fd1d61c0395c68821ba228e108192ec3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,104,31,168,253,29,97,192,57,92,104,130,27,162,40,225,8,25,46,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
