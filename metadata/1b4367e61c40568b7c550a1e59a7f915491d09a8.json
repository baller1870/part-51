Shot during 2004 \nand 2005, it documents a transformative time as Hamas entered the \npolitical arena, even as its main leaders were assassinated one by \none. Interviews with leaders in hiding, militants and activists are \njuxtaposed with Israeli experts and victims, as the film examines how \nHamas turned the once secular struggle for Palestine into a \nreligiously motivated Jihad. What emerges is a portrait of a starkly \nresilient group; when thousands of their members were imprisoned they \nturned the prison into a university for ideological discourse. When \nfaced with Israeli fences and lock-downs against their attacks, they \ndug underground. When their leaders were killed, their recruitment \ngrew. Their popularity in the Palestinian street kept growing, in \npart because of their vast social network and in part because their \narmed resistance appealed most when public desperation was highest. \nAnd even though they were put on the international terrorist list by \nthe US, they were able to increase their funding. On the world front, \nHamas has become a pivotal player in any real and meaningful peace \nprospects. As Hamas now enters the political arena they face a \nstrategic question. Will they play inside the box? \nHamas: Behind The Mask is a look at the people behind the stereo-typed\nterrorist mask, who have become a major force in shaping the future \nof a Palestinian state and an end to the enduring Middle Eastern \nconflict. \n\n_________________________________________________________________d0x__\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b4367e61c40568b7c550a1e59a7f915491d09a8","amp;dn":"Hamas+-+Behind+The+Mask","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b4367e61c40568b7c550a1e59a7f915491d09a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,67,103,230,28,64,86,139,124,85,10,30,89,167,249,21,73,29,9,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
