It was not exactly what I expected... a journey into a supernatural realm. The special effects were simply awesome! Robin Williams will never cease to amaze me. He gave a wonderful performance, as did Annabella Sciora, and Cuba Gooding, Jr. True love, the kind that puts your partner before yourself, is clearly shown in this film. The film also makes you what to call everyone you haven&amp;#039;t talked to for a while and let them know how you feel about them. It gives the viewer lots to discuss. I&amp;#039;ve seen it 3 times. Once alone, once with my grown daughter, and once with my boyfriend. \n\nWas the above comment useful to you?   \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c97c7904fe1f6a376115ac029635e65014612c3","amp;dn":"What+Dreams+May+Come+-+1998+-+Robin+Williams+%28Life+after+death%2C+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c97c7904fe1f6a376115ac029635e65014612c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,151,199,144,79,225,246,163,118,17,90,192,41,99,94,101,1,70,18,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
