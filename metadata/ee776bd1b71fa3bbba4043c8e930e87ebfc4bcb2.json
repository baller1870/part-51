It does not represent what you will find in Infinity. Its goal is, namely, to test: the graphics engine, the physics engine, the networking engine, experiment with controls / combat mechanics / balance, to improve stability/fix bugs and measure/stress performance.\n\nThe combat prototype is not meant to have a deep gameplay; do not expect any form of planetary landing. 10 ships are available to the players. The gameplay is arena (team vs team) based, while Infinity will be a fully open &quot;sandbox&quot; type of game","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee776bd1b71fa3bbba4043c8e930e87ebfc4bcb2","amp;dn":"Infinity+-+TQFE+ICP+2.1+Client","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee776bd1b71fa3bbba4043c8e930e87ebfc4bcb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,119,107,209,183,31,163,187,186,64,67,200,233,48,232,126,191,196,188,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
