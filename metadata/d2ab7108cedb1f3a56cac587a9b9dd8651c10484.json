Disc One combines AZ&amp;#039;s effortless flow with some of the most funky and soulful tracks you&amp;#039;ll come across. The second disc is comprised of all new, never released AZ cuts that sound as good on the streets as they do in the club. The result is pure start to finish listening pleasure for the audience as AZ&amp;#039;s most popular acapellas are blended with beats reminiscent of 1970&amp;#039;s Memphis. The success of Guru&amp;#039;s &quot;Jazzmatazz&quot; albums proves that combining Hip Hop with other genres of music is a cutting-edge theme that&amp;#039;s bound to be more common in the future.
