There are dozens of characters, some seen only briefly, who together weave the story of five separate invasion points that made up the operation.\n\nEngland in June 1944. Unseasonal storms. Allied troops are massed ready for the invasion of France, some already on the boats. The Normandy beaches will be their destination while paratroopers are dropped inland to take key towns and bridges. On the other side of the Channel the Germans still expect the invasion at Calais, and anyway the weather makes them think nothing is likely to be imminent. Eisenhower decides to go. Hitler sleeps on.\n\nThe retelling of June 6, 1944, from the perspectives of the Germans, the US, Britain, and the Free French. Marshall Erwin Rommel, touring the defenses being established as part of the Reich&amp;#039;s Atlantic Wall, notes to his officers that when the Allied invasion comes they must be stopped on the beach. &quot;For the Allies as well as the Germans, it will be the longest day. The longest day.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccf47a2124ef769c6b8de4d47691091b562e1e2c","amp;dn":"The+Longest+Day+%281962%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccf47a2124ef769c6b8de4d47691091b562e1e2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,244,122,33,36,239,118,156,107,141,228,212,118,145,9,27,86,46,30,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
