The album is produced by\nHoppus and Barker and executive produced by long-time blink-182 producer Jerry\nFinn.\n\nRecruited for their new journey as (+44) ÃƒÂ» pronounced ÃƒÂ´Plus 44ÃƒÂ¶ ÃƒÂ» Shane\nGallagher (The Nervous Return) and Craig Fairbaugh (Transplants, The Forgotten,\nLars Frederiksen and the Bastards) join singer-bassist Hoppus and\ndrummer-keyboardist Barker and pick up where the popular, multi-platinum-\nselling band blink-182 left off after splitting in late 2004. ÃƒÂ´We were twothirds\nof blink-182, so weÃƒâ€ re not afraid of sounding like ourselves,ÃƒÂ¶ says Hoppus.\nÃƒÂ´WeÃƒâ€ re not divorcing ourselves from the past, but we are pushing beyond the\npast. WeÃƒâ€ re progressing like musicians should.ÃƒÂ¶ Barker agrees: ÃƒÂ´Mark and I have\na natural chemistry after playing together for so long and itÃƒâ€ s only gotten\nstronger. This band is a continuation of blink-182 but itÃƒâ€ s also different. For\na long time, blink-182 was an underdog. I like being the underdog again.ÃƒÂ¶","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:103278b8816be3fcea9f44f68c400e213ddfdafd","amp;dn":"Plus_44-WheYour_HearStops_Beating-2006-RNS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"103278b8816be3fcea9f44f68c400e213ddfdafd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,50,120,184,129,107,227,252,234,159,68,246,140,64,14,33,61,223,218,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
