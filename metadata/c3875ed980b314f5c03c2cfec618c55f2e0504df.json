It was produced by the Jim Henson Company and Hallmark Entertainment, and filmed in Australia. Drawing on Henson&amp;#039;s traditional expertise in puppetry, two of the main characters are animatronic puppets.\n\nThe show was abruptly canceled after it had completed production of its fourth season, with a fifth season contracted, effectively ending the series on a cliffhanger. A mini-series in 2004 wrapped up some of the show&amp;#039;s hanging plot threads and new webisodes are being produced.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3875ed980b314f5c03c2cfec618c55f2e0504df","amp;dn":"Farscape-I%2C+E.T-S01E02.Custom.Swesub.By.FLOFFE.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3875ed980b314f5c03c2cfec618c55f2e0504df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,135,94,217,128,179,20,245,192,60,44,254,198,24,197,95,46,5,4,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
