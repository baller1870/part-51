It is this two-pronged female\n     approach that distinguishes these Swedes from the\n     rest of the crowd and gives them their own unique\n     sound. The debut EP &amp;#039;Wasting Life&amp;#039; doesn?t sound\n     like NIGHTWISH or WITHIN TEMPTATION or\n     EVANESCENCE?on the contrary, it sounds like nothing\n     other than ALL ENDS!\n\n     &quot;And if the name &amp;#039;Gelotte&amp;#039; sounds familiar, then it\n     should, because IN FLAMES guitarist BjÃƒÂ¶rn Gelotte\n     is the brother of singer Emma. BjÃƒÂ¶rn and his\n     bandmate Jesper StrÃƒÂ¶mblad are highly creative\n     songwriters with a huge musical spectrum, and the\n     inspiration for ALL ENDS. Jesper and BjÃƒÂ¶rn&amp;#039;s role\n     with ALL ENDS is solely a creative involvement\n     behind the scenes.\n\n     &quot;The fact that ALL ENDS is made up of five top\n     musicians of their genre is evident in the\n     magnificent &amp;#039;Alone&amp;#039;, which skillfully treads the\n     line between metallic wrecking ball and pop anthem.\n     And the title track, &amp;#039;Wasting Life&amp;#039;, is also\n     equally characterized by the simultaneously\n     powerfully and melodic guitar work that is simply\n     irresistible in combination with the sleek grooves\n     and whale-sized hooks.&quot;\n\n     ALL ENDS will take part in the Eartshaker Roadshock\n     Tour beginning late April. Also scheduled to appear\n     on the bill are FINNTROLL, AFTER FOREVER, TAROT,\n     DIE APOKALYPTISCHEN REITER and MACHINE MEN\n\n\n     www.allends.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eba478110700d932237605e82faad6e91793455e","amp;dn":"All_Ends_-_Wasting_Life-Promo_CDM-2007-MOD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eba478110700d932237605e82faad6e91793455e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,164,120,17,7,0,217,50,35,118,5,232,47,170,214,233,23,147,69,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
