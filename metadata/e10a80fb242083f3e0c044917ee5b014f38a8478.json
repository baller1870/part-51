We will take no requests; these albums are all we are willing to offer you, including one dedicated machine that will seed this very torrent until January 1st, 2008.\n\nAfter that it is up to you people to keep this torrent seeded and alive as we will not offer you a re-seed or a steady seeder beyond said day.\n\nThe single songs are coded to 320 kbyte/s and encoded as mp3s.\n\nGood day to you all, the clock is ticking for freedom. \nOur freedom.\n\n- net.engineer\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e10a80fb242083f3e0c044917ee5b014f38a8478","amp;dn":"HeavensDust","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e10a80fb242083f3e0c044917ee5b014f38a8478","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,10,128,251,36,32,131,243,224,192,68,145,126,229,176,20,243,138,132,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
