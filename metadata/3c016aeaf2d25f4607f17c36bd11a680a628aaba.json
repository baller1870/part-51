Valiant (Ewan McGregor) and his fine, feathered friends take to the sky on a wing and a prayer to prove that it&amp;#039;s not your wingspan but the size of your spirit that truly counts. Together this rag-tag squadron of birdbrains engages in hilarious aerial adventures at a spitfire pace. From the first bumbling day of basic training through the final feather-raising mission, the flock of comical characters swoops their way toward victory. From the producer of SHREK and SHREK 2, VALIANT delivers stunning animation, a top-flight voice cast, and an action-packed story loaded with laughs. It&amp;#039;s a soaring family comedy that truly earns its wings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c016aeaf2d25f4607f17c36bd11a680a628aaba","amp;dn":"Valiant.English.DVDRip.XVid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c016aeaf2d25f4607f17c36bd11a680a628aaba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,1,106,234,242,210,95,70,7,241,124,54,189,17,166,128,166,40,170,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
