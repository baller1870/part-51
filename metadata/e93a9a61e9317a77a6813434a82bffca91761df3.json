I looked through it and realized that most of the WAD files that are on the disc are extinct to the world. Someone out there might find this torrent useful if you still play Doom Legacy or another port of the game.\n\nEditors and Trainers that were on the CD are also included, but I wouldn&amp;#039;t expect them to run on XP or the like. DosBOX maybe.\n\nNostalga is fun.
