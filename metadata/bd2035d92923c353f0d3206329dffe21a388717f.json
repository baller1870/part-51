More information at http://meetthegimp.org\n\nEpisode 017: Selecting Selections (Part 1)\n\nSelections are widely used in Gimp. Select something to work only on that, to cut or copy it, to move it around.....\n\nIn this video I cover the basics of selections, the usage of the rectangle, elipse and free hand selection tool with all their options, the different selection modes (replacing, adding, substracting and intersecting)  and the different keyboard shortcuts you can use. Yes, there is a difference between first pressing shift and then the mouse or the other way around. \n\nFinally I show you how to work with the Quickmask to make finetunings to your selection and how to save a selection for later use in a channel.  \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd2035d92923c353f0d3206329dffe21a388717f","amp;dn":"Meet_the_Gimp_Videopodcast_Episode_017","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd2035d92923c353f0d3206329dffe21a388717f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,32,53,217,41,35,195,83,240,211,32,99,41,223,254,33,163,136,113,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
