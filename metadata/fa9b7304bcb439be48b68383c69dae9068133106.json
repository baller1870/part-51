The British secret service are naturally keen to learn if these notebooks are the genuine article. To this end, they enlist the help of the scruffy British publisher Barley Blair, who has plenty of experience with Russian and Russians. Barley, an unconventionaly character who doesn&amp;#039;t respond well to authority, finds himself in a game more complex than he first thought when he digs into the origin of the notebooks.\n\nAnyDVD, DVDRemake Pro, DVDRebuilder+CEE 4 pass\n\n- Reduction Level for DVD-5: 56.5%\n- Overall Bitrate : 4&amp;#039;072Kbs\n- Space for Video : 3&amp;#039;521&amp;#039;782KB\n- HIGH/LOW/TYPICAL Bitrates: 4&amp;#039;360/3&amp;#039;945/4&amp;#039;072 Kbs \n\nPLEASE VISIT WWW.DVDQUORUM.ES Ã‚Â¡Ã‚Â¡Ã‚Â¡NOW IN ENGLISH!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa9b7304bcb439be48b68383c69dae9068133106","amp;dn":"%28Ciclo+Sean+Connery%29+The+Russia+House","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa9b7304bcb439be48b68383c69dae9068133106","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,155,115,4,188,180,57,190,72,182,131,131,198,157,174,144,104,19,49,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
