In the single-player puzzle game, the goal is simply to clear the arena of balls. The two player game pits two players against each other. Both players have an arena each (both visible on screen) and an identical arrangement of coloured balls in each arena. When a player removes a large group (four balls or more) some of the balls removed percolate over to the opponent&amp;#039;s arena, usually frustrating his efforts at trying to remove all the balls from the arena. The two player game can also be played by one player against a computer opponent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9d3521012084ea4f3f6fcbd51531817d5e53667","amp;dn":"Bust+A+Move+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9d3521012084ea4f3f6fcbd51531817d5e53667","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,211,82,16,18,8,78,164,243,246,252,189,81,83,24,23,213,229,54,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
