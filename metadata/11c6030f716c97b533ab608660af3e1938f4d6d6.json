The \n              evidence also reveals that Delko and Nick fought \n              earlier in the day. In another case, a wealthy single \n              man is found dead in his mansion with a granite-topped\n              bookshelf on top of him. The investigation reveals the\n              victim was seeing a therapist who suddenly dropped him \n              as a patient.            \n\n\n\n               NOTES: Think you have what it takes to be a 442 \n                     member?\n\n                     We have a few rare openings for HDTV \n                     capper/encoders.
