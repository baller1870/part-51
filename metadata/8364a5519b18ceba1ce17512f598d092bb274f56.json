Let me list some of the reasons why:\n\n\n\t\t1.) It&amp;#039;s Free\n\t\t2.) It&amp;#039;s Ultra-Realistic\n\t\t3.)

And a picture of the Badges you can earn while training.\n\t\n\tI&amp;#039;ve also included the torrent file (Courtesy of www.americasarmy.com) You can use the torrent file to easily download America&amp;#039;s Army, the only downside is the file is around 2.8GB. So I suggest you clear some room on your hard drive, or if you have an external hard drive then put it on there (Suggestion)...\n\n===================================\nSystem Requirements:\n\nRecommended System Requirements:\n\n        * 3-D graphics card with 256mb+ memory and support for hardware\n          transformation and lighting\n        * 3.0 GHz processor or equivalent\n        * English version of Windows(r) 2000/XP Operating System with latest updates\n        * 1gb RAM\n        * 3.5gb of uncompressed hard disk space for game files\n        * DVD-ROM (not required for downloaded installations)\n        * Windows 2000/XP compatible system (including compatible 32-bit drivers for video card, sound card, mouse and keyboard)\n        * DirectX(r)9.0\n        * 100% Compatible DirectX 9.0 soundcard\n        * Broadband Network Connection\n        * *NVIDIA(r) nForce(tm) or other motherboards/soundcards containing the Dolby(r) Digital Interactive Content Encoder required for Dolby Digital audio\n\n\t\n\nMinimum System Requirements:\n\n        * 3-D graphics card with 128mb memory and support for hardware\n          transformation and lighting\n        * 2.4 GHz processor or equivalent\n        * English version of Windows(r) 2000/XP Operating System with all updates\n        * 512mb RAM\n        * 3.5gb of uncompressed hard disk space for game files\n        * DVD-ROM (not required for downloaded installation)\n        * Windows 2000/XP compatible system (including compatible 32-bit drivers for video card, sound card, mouse and keyboard)\n        * DirectX(r) 9.0\n        * 100% Compatible DirectX 9.0 soundcard\n        * 56kbps Modem or other network connection\n\n          *NvidiaÃ‚Â® nForce? or other motherboard/soundcards containing Dolby DigitalÃ‚Â® Content Encoder required for Dolby DigitalÃ‚Â® audio.\n\n=================================================\n\n\nSystem Requirement Info, In-game videos (Taken by me with the use of FRAPS), &amp; Torrent File (For the game) courtesy of www.americasarmy.com\n\n\n================================================\n\nNOTE: www.americasarmy.com puts this warning for Torrent users!-&gt;\n\n*** WARNING FOR GOVERNMENT COMPUTER USERS ***\nYou should not use Bit Torrent files if you are operating a government computer.
