It is a rare film to enjoy as it shows how these amazing creatures migrate from place to place in such incredible fashion. \n\nThe colors and the backgrounds behind the different species are photographed with such an eye to detail that one wonders the miracle of the technology behind it. One thing that never ceased to surprise me was the way most birds are shown flying in perfect formation as the camera seems to be part of the flock and it&amp;#039;s just going along for the ride.\n\nContrary to what other people have experienced in watching this film, time practically &quot;flew&quot; for me as it was never boring, even though we are constantly looking at birds that are somehow similar doing the same thing over and over. \n\nIt\\&amp;#039;s surprising that this documentary has been shown in art houses to grown ups, mainly. It is a film that would be suitable for children instead of other kinds of violent cartoons, or films that emphasize the brutal force in humans. \n\nI&amp;#039;ll take the birds, anytime!\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff750b46bbc10a88b689353191a77509fd6fcf5f","amp;dn":"WINGEDMIGRATION_FLYTTF%C3%85GLAR_DVD5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff750b46bbc10a88b689353191a77509fd6fcf5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,117,11,70,187,193,10,136,182,137,53,49,145,167,117,9,253,111,207,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
