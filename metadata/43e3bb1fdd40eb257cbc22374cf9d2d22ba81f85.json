HiVi CAST will maximize the potential of your systems!\n\nNo matter how you collect your latest AV equipment such as a DVD recorder, flat TV or increase the number of speaker systems, if you do so without the proper set up, you will not be able to take advantage of your expensive investment. In other words, they need to be coordinated well in order to manifest the true potentials of any software. We produced HiVi CAST for obtaining this goal. The members of this project team are from HiVi magazine and Home Theatre magazine, both of which have been published in Japan. This team aims to provide the latest information regarding audio and visual technology and equipments for broader audiences who want to enjoy films and music in the best environment possible. We assure to you that HiVi CAST will improve your sound and visual environment in your home theatre.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43e3bb1fdd40eb257cbc22374cf9d2d22ba81f85","amp;dn":"HiVi+CAST+-+Navigator+Check+%26+Adjustment+%2C+the+ultimate+testing+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43e3bb1fdd40eb257cbc22374cf9d2d22ba81f85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,227,187,31,221,64,235,37,124,188,34,55,76,249,210,210,43,168,31,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
