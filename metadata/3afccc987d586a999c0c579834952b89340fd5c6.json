In those episodes, Tony Soprano faced new challenges as his life grew increasingly more complicated. Back together with Carmela, he faced the reality that their kids were no longer children, and yet not grown. And with Johnny Sack in prison, the always-tense relations between the New Jersey and New York families were strained even further. \n\nAs Season Six continues, he&amp;#039;ll be facing new stresses, including life-altering decisions at home, pressure from the law, and trouble on the job that leaves no one - no one - above suspicion. \n\nCreator David Chase&amp;#039;s drama series stars three-time EmmyÃ‚Â® winners James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano and Edie Falco as Tony&amp;#039;s wife Carmela, plus Lorraine Bracco as therapist Dr. Jennifer Melfi, EmmyÃ‚Â® winner Michael Imperioli as Tony&amp;#039;s nephew Christopher Moltisanti, and Dominic Chianese as Uncle Junior.
