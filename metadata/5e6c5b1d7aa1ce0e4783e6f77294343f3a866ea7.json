More information at http://meetthegimp.org\n\nEpisode 6: Selective sharpening\n\nEvery digital image needs sharpening. But sharpening increases the noise in the image. In this episode I show a way to sharpen only the areas that need to be sharpened - the edges between different colours or levels of brightness. All the other parts of the image are left alone and so the noise stays down.\n\nSharpening should always be the very last thing you do with your image.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e6c5b1d7aa1ce0e4783e6f77294343f3a866ea7","amp;dn":"%5C%22Meet+the+Gimp%21%5C%22+Videopodcast+Episode+6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e6c5b1d7aa1ce0e4783e6f77294343f3a866ea7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,108,91,29,122,161,206,14,71,131,230,247,114,148,52,63,58,134,110,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
