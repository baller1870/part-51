Hopefully SVN is more stable this time.\n   I&amp;#039;m also including the &amp;#039;XBMC Win32 PC environment&amp;#039; .exe that is meant for skinners &amp; python developers, read more about the concept here http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/forum/showthread.php?p=115893. It was built using Microsoft DirectX Summer 2004 SDK. \n\n\nNOTEWORTHY SVN CHANGES SINCE LAST T3CH (according to T3CH)__________________\n\n   sources.xml:\n   keymap.xml:\n\n\nINFORMATION_________________________________________________________________\n   XBMC&amp;#039;s online manual can be found at http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki.\n   Any questions or support issues, are best asked in the XBMC support forums, \n   which are located at http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/forum, \n   or in the official IRC support channel, #XBMC on Freenode IRC network (irc.freenode.net). \n   (NOTE folks in #XBMC can&amp;#039;t help with info where to find builds)\n\n   If you want other skins (make sure they are up-to-date and compatible before installing them), see:\n o http://www.allxboxskins.com/skins/index.php?app=XBMC&amp;cat=0 or\n o http://www.xbox-skins.net/forums/index.php?dlcategory=7 \n   there&amp;#039;s a list of 2.0 compatible skins here:\n o http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/forum/showthread.php?t=19374\n\n   If you want other scripts (extra 3rd party components), see\n o http://www.xbmcscripts.com or use the included script installer!\n\n   If you want trainers, grab them at\n o http://www.xboxtrainers.net (no registration required) or\n o http://www.google.com/search?q=xbox+trainers\n\n   The xbe has been retail patched and was built using v5849 of the XDK.\n\n   If you want to remove the startup logo, remove splash.png from the media folder.\n   If you want to remove the startup sound, remove start.wav from the skinProject Mayhem IIIsounds folder.\n\n   XBMC Changelog is included, see Changelog.txt\n   Skin Changelog is included, see Changelog_PM.txt\n\n\nAPPLICATION INSTALL_________________________________________________________\n   Fresh Install: Transfer _whole_ XBMC folder to your APPS folder (or where you want it).\n\n   Upgrade: Backup the XBMCUserData folder. Transfer whole XBMC folder to Xbox. \n            Overwrite UserData folder with your backed up copy. \n\n\nDASHBOARD INSTALL (SOFTMODS)_____________________________________________\n   ARE NOT COVERED IN THIS README, SEE http://forums.xbox-scene.com/index.php?showtopic=406656\n\n\nDASHBOARD INSTALL___________________________________________________________\n   Option 1. Team XBMC&amp;#039;s shortcut tool. \n   It&amp;#039;s included in the _tools folder as &lt;&lt;SHORTCUT by TEAM XBMC.xbe&gt;&gt; + &lt;&lt;SHORTCUT by TEAM XBMC.cfg&gt;&gt;.\n   Instructions here: http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=As_a_Dashboard (Option 1).\n   Rename the &lt;&lt;SHORTCUT by TEAM XBMC.xbe&gt;&gt;+.cfg &amp; also EDIT the .cfg so it matches your config. \n   See APPLICATION INSTALL above.\n\n   Option 2. Thanks to an app called &amp;#039;Team UIX&amp;#039;s Xbe Shortcut Maker v1.0&amp;#039; by JbOnE, it&amp;#039;s now easy...\n   Transfer contents of XBMC folder (this is VERY important since the tool is hardcoded) \n   TO &quot;E:APPSXBMC&quot;. Rename &lt;&lt;SHORTCUT by TEAM UIX.xbe&gt;&gt; to something your bios can boot \n   (see http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/wiki/index.php?title=As_a_Dashboard or read your \n   BIOS README) and transfer to location your mod solution boots. No need to fiddle with HOME tag anymore, \n   and future upgrades you need not to worry about this file (unless you move XBMC).\n\n\nWIN32 PC ENVIRONMENT INSTRUCTIONS (WIN32 FOLDER)____________________________\n   Good to know, this requires DirectX9 Runtimes to be installed. Also this doesn&amp;#039;t work with all graphics cards.\n   You need to:\n o Copy XBMC_PC.exe &amp; &amp;#039;run_me_first.bat&amp;#039; from win32 to XBMC folder\n o Run &amp;#039;run_me_first.bat&amp;#039;\n o Run XBMC_PC.exe\n\n\nUPGRADE TIPS________________________________________________________________\n   If you&amp;#039;re updating from a VERY old/bad build you may get issues. Follow these simple rules:\n o Replace (FTP OVERWRITE) all files in your XBMC folder with fresh ones from your new build\n o Delete old settings (from UserData/guisettings.xml)\n o In some rare cases some of the database files in UserData/Database/*.db may need manual deletion \n   (usually if they are very old). Note: This loses all per file settings you made with the old build!\n\n\nTWEAKS BY T3CH______________________________________________________________\n   I&amp;#039;ve cleaned up the scripts menu, &gt;&gt;XBMCskinProject Mayhem IIIpaldialogsubmenu.xml&lt;&lt; \n   (used for all resolutions) to only show the included QuickTimeBrowser &amp; &quot;XBMCScripts&quot; scripts.\n   If you add scripts yourself, this is the file to edit or replace.\n\n\nLAST WORDS__________________________________________________________________\n   Who is T3CH? - Revealed on a -need to know basis-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72b68295db692fc5d78d2a9c093f962c27a62434","amp;dn":"XBMC-SVN_2006-12-10_rev7340-T3CH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72b68295db692fc5d78d2a9c093f962c27a62434","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,182,130,149,219,105,47,197,215,141,42,156,9,63,150,44,39,166,36,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
