Originally the video was to be named Mtn Lab 2.0 but the poor snow season forced reconsideration of the title. Despite that, the video still definitely lives up to the Mtn. Lab name and showcases the fun and importance of the Lab for DC. Following in the same spirit of The Mtn.Lab, the video takes a fun look at the team as they hit spots worldwide and, of course, DCÃƒÂ¢??s infamous Mtn.Lab in Utah. The remodeled Lab provides ample park footage along with big mountain terrain from Chile, Finland, B.C. Canada, Sweden, Tahoe, Colorado and New Zealand. Directed by Pierre Wikberg, of The Mtn.Lab Video and Robot Food Trilogy, Mtn.Lab 1.5 features DCÃƒÂ¢??s entire pro team including itÃƒÂ¢??s international amateur members: Devun Walsh, Aaron Bittner, Iikka Backstom, Lauri Heiskari, Todd Richards, Travis Rice, Eddie Wall, Bjorn Lienes, Chas Guldemond, Torstein Horgmo and Jonas Carlson.\n\nDVD FEATURES:\nFilmed at the DC Mtn.Lab and outside the gates and locations worldwide.\nFeaturing the DC Snowboarding Team and lots of special guests including other DC athletes.\nTons of bonus features and behind the scenes footage.\nSuper secret movie sections\nExclusive footage of DC co-founder Ken Block jumping his Subaru STI.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:557725f427d21a0db3693ff009ece608ea099e75","amp;dn":"SNOWBOARD.08.DC_MTN_LAB_1_5.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"557725f427d21a0db3693ff009ece608ea099e75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,119,37,244,39,210,26,13,179,105,63,240,9,236,230,8,234,9,158,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
