An ARCHIVE long thought lost in the annuls of flight-sim mythology. Here my friends I present to you a piece of historical significance by the esteemed but extremely reclusive photo re-constructionalist himself...... Raimondo Taburet. \n\nBelow you will find is the ONLY ..(search you muthers if you must)..  mention of this sadly forgotten and long abandoned masterpiece....\n\nhxxp://www.simflight.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=4008\n\n....from what has been written....this is the Lost City of Chicago memorialized in all of it&amp;#039;s glory...sitting in splendor on the western shore of Lake Michigan (which from the air has the shape of a very limp dick) in that grand country - the U.S. of A. Now you will once more be able to cruise the windy skies of this glorious city......going in never-ending circles around that great black Phallic symbol in the middle of town erected by I am told....Mr Sears himself. As an added extra for those that fly very lowwwwww.....and fly very...very slowwwww, the south side features a veritable plethura of not to be missed ?muggings - rapes - robberies - gangland shootings and arsons that have never before been captured in a flight-sim till now.\n\nDedicated to the Guy who fell off his Hamster?.
