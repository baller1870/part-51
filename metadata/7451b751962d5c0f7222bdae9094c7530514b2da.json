Kate Grisham\n\nSYNOPSIS.\n\n\n\nDetective Jeff Slade teams up with scientist Holly Turner, who&amp;#039;s late father has created a time machine that can travel back several hours. Together they solve mysteries using the device. In the beginning of episodes (before they travel back in time), things happen because they DID travel back in time, and they are constantly working to avoid paradoxes. This approach to time-travel is unusual in sci-fi movies, and keeps the plot twisted.\n\nNot the greatest TV show ever made,but worth a watch and hard to find now.\n\nAll together only 2 series and 8 episodes were made.\n\n\nDIVX format. 16:9 aspect.\n\nDVD rip.  \t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7451b751962d5c0f7222bdae9094c7530514b2da","amp;dn":"Crime+Traveller+Episode+03.DIVX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7451b751962d5c0f7222bdae9094c7530514b2da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,81,183,81,150,45,92,15,114,34,189,174,144,148,199,83,5,20,178,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
