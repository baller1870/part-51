The first version of Adaptec I had used completely crashed my PC which forced a reformat. This made it easy to choose Nero at that time. Since then, times have definitely changed and the feature list is ever growing. We will be taking a look through the latest Ultra Edition to see what&amp;#039;s new and noteworthy. There is so much packed into the Ultra Edition that we will not be able to tackle it all, but rather mention features that stand out.\n\nWhen you look to purchase some burning software, you obviously want it to be able to burn your data and probably make audio CD&amp;#039;s. You are certainly missing out on a lot if that&amp;#039;s all you want to do, as you can see in the below feature list. Needless to say, Nero is a complete media suite that is for much more than simply burning.\n\nFor those of you who are interested in a no-nonsense list of what&amp;#039;s new in 7, Nero has provided this:\n\nBurning and Copying\nFull-o-meter automatically adjusts to you project type (DVD-1, DVD-5 or DVD-9) \nIntelligent size calculation will suggest a DVD if data will not fit on a CD \nNew, easy-to-use GUI for Nero Express and Nero InCD \nUse Nero Scout to index your digital media making it easy to find the right video or song for your CD or DVD \nSupport for Blu-ray (BD-RE and BD-R) media\nAudio\nSupport for 5.1 and 7.1 audio recording, editing and mixing \nCreate beats, melodies and sound sequences \nHQ mastering (192KHz) resolution audio supported \nUp to 32 bit audio supported \nSample looper \nRip tracks from audio CDs (SoundTrax) \nAdjust tempo of samples &amp; loops to mixes for seamless track transitions \nNew surround effects \nPump-up your music mixes with powerful Beat Editor, Sequencer and Text II Speech converter\nPhoto and Video\nHDV capture support \nCompress video to fit mobile, PDAs, home theater and HDTV standards \nDolby Digital 5.1 Encoder integration \nExtend capture device support \nExport slideshows to share or archive \nNew 2D and animated 3D menu templates to spice up your home-made professional quality DVDs \nCapture, edit and export High-Definition (HD) video files. \nBrowse customized image directories \nBurn to DVD, SVCD and VCD or export to video file for sharing \nStream media files across any UPnP? compatible devices\nDVD\nSupport for chapter menus (DVD+VR) \nSplit and merge titles (DVD+VR) \nAutomatically overwrite unprotected titles if space on disc is low (DVD+VR) \nAdd/remove images from slideshows (DVD-VR) \nSimulation/Preview of DVD-VR project \nLooped DVD navigation \nDVD-Audio support\nBackup\nBackup without logging in \nAdvanced calendar &amp; scheduling for backup jobs \nInCD 5 Drag&amp;Drop file backup support for BDRE/R (Blu-ray) \nFTP backup \nIntelligent compression filter \nShadow Copy feature used to ensure a verified backup \nAdvanced pre &amp; post scripting features \nSecure your data with 128-bit encryption &amp; password protection \nBackup access rights of files and folders in NTFS volumes \nBackup to disc images \nCreate bootable restore disc \nVerify existing backup \nVirus protection of backups \nBackup on login \nBackup directly from Windows Explorer \nBackup drives onto hard disks (internal and external)\nPlayback and Share\nMetallic skin (Nero ShowTime) \nMultitask when using Nero Home (e.g. Watch TV while creating a slideshow). \nSupports playslists that consist of multiple media formats such as pictures, music and video \nPowerful database to store and organize your media \nCompatible with popular remote controls to play your pictures, music, video and TV. \nTime-shift TV \nQuick and easy access to all of your Digital media files using Nero Home&amp;#039;s advanced search features\nExtras\nNero Scout (enables a user to easily catalog and find media files located on the computer) \nAdd/Remove languages in the Nero ProductSetup \nRepair option to fix damaged installations of Nero \nCustomize installer to tailor your Nero applications to your needs \nIn-program updates\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8cfcfd5ba2e9e8df073d1ffd5f6d7b85e21dc29","amp;dn":"Nero+7+incl+Keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8cfcfd5ba2e9e8df073d1ffd5f6d7b85e21dc29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,207,207,213,186,46,158,141,240,115,209,255,213,246,215,184,94,33,220,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
