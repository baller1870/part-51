His brother, Lincoln Burrows, was convicted of a crime he didn&amp;#039;t commit and put on Death Row. Michael holds up a bank to get himself incarcerated alongside his brother in Fox River State Penitentiary, then sets in motion a series of elaborate plans to break Lincoln out and prove his innocence. Once out of jail, their perils aren&amp;#039;t over -- the brothers must flee to escape recapture and battle an intricate political conspiracy that puts everyone&amp;#039;s life at risk.
