A boy communicates telepathically with his dog as they scavenge for food and sex, and they stumble into an underground society where the old society is preserved. The daughter of one of the leaders of the community seduces and lures him below, where the citizens have become unable to reproduce because of being underground so long. They use him for impregnation purposes, and then plan to be rid of him.\n\nDon Johnson plays a young man in a post nuclear war world who has an interesting friend, a telepathic dog. The dog gives him an advantage in dealing with the barbaric world he lives in. When Johnson finds one place that has escaped the devastation of the war, he also finds some rather odd attitudes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5adab3934cc10e336111231f98bbb9fae7b2feb3","amp;dn":"Boy.And.His.Dog","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5adab3934cc10e336111231f98bbb9fae7b2feb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,218,179,147,76,193,14,51,97,17,35,31,152,187,185,250,231,178,254,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
