His first solo piano CD is a sparkler. The vaguely Chopinesque pieces are tuneful and easy to listen to, Harriss&amp;#039;s keyboard touch is confident, and the production (recorded at Chick Corea&amp;#039;s Mad Hatter studio) is flawless.&quot;\n\n-- Jim Aiken, KEYBOARD Magazine - April 2001\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Harriss brings a keen sense of melody and form to his compositions.&quot;\n\n-- Steve Feinstein, KKSF RADIO\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Spacious, warm release paints a textured landscape that is by turns soothing...and jaunty. Programmers should find a depth here that exceeds most other releases of the same genre.&quot;\n\n-- NEW AGE PICKS, BILLBOARD MAGAZINE\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;...he is light-years ahead of most adult contemporary synthesists in his sophisticated use of texture and sound.&quot;\n\n-- Linda Kohanov, ALL-MUSIC GUIDE\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Moving adeptly from his rangy repertoire of electronic musics to engaging, impromptu rhythms, Don starts out in the area where Windham Hill&amp;#039;s new electronic music series is heading, climbs up through the pristine Private Music styles that Patrick O&amp;#039;Hearn creates, and flies out brilliantly into some of the floatiest dream clouds we&amp;#039;ve lietened on. Subdued, simple and right on the mark.&quot;\n\n-- HEARTBEATS/BACKROADS\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Don Harriss is one of the most innovative new age musicians in the business today, having released five critically acclaimed albums in the past decade. It&amp;#039;s Harriss&amp;#039; combination of acoustic and synthesized instrumentation and his warm, inviting melodies that account for his success.&quot;\n\n-- Mary Lynn McCarrick, JAZZ NOTES\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;You&amp;#039;d never know that Don Harriss was once a member of rocker Pat Travers&amp;#039; Band from listening to his three solo discs. His recent music is about as far away from rock&amp;#039;n&amp;#039;roll as you can get. The latest, ABACUS MOON, features all the hallmarks of the &quot;Don Harriss sound,&quot; simple melodies with beautiful electronic orchestrations.\n\n\n-- Michael Reading, PAC ATTACKS\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;I listened to the new Don Harriss album with a degree of apprehension because his first album was so good. I couldn&amp;#039;t believe it was possible. VANISHING POINT is better.&quot;\n\n\n-- John Sebastian, KTWV &quot;THE WAVE (L.A.)&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;A beautifully composed and orchestrated album - at once minimal and subdued while being full and richly orchestrated.&quot;\n\n\n-- Brad Balfour, REFLEX MAGAZINE\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Harriss uplifts with inner vision and beauty.&quot;\n\n\n-- Lee Underwood, PULSE! MAGAZINE\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Here&amp;#039;s your chance to catch a rising star&quot;\n\n\n-- Robert Carlberg, ELECTRONIC MUSICIAN MAGAZINE\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Don Harriss&amp;#039;s fourth release, Shell Game, is an unqualified success. At first, it seemed he had made another solid album, blending his familiar style with predictable pop hooks, but nothing earthshaking or monumental. Upon closer examination, however, it became apparent that Harriss had developed his music with true craftsmanship, creating a work of immense depth and listenability. He heads off in several directions on the various pieces, many which explore downright romantic spaces. Some compositions, like &quot;Arabesque,&quot; come at you from a distance, while others, like &quot;White Sand and Thunder&quot; and the title track really pack a punch. Half the pieces benefit from the contributions of other musicians, notably Peter Maunu on guitars and Luis Conte on percussion. Don&amp;#039;s performing background in rock music (with the Pat Travers Band) shows through here and there, but his abilities as crafty composer and arranger and his precise production are evident throughout, making Shell Game a strong contender for anybody&amp;#039;s TOP TEN LIST FOR 1990.&quot;\n-- BACKROADS MUSIC/HEARTBEATS(BACKROADS MUSIC/HEART), ALL-MUSIC GUIDE\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa48959a4aff3ef0d606e6b268bf9ce4b6b54598","amp;dn":"Don+Harriss+-+Abacus+Moon+-+New+Age+1989","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa48959a4aff3ef0d606e6b268bf9ce4b6b54598","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,72,149,154,74,255,62,240,214,6,230,178,104,191,156,228,182,181,69,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
