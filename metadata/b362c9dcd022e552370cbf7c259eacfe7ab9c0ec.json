Instead, Jason Bourne is now hunted by the people who made him what he is. Having lost his memory and the one person he loved, he is undeterred by the barrage of bullets and a new generation of highly-trained killers. Bourne has only one objective: to go back to the beginning and find out who he was. \n\nNow, in the new chapter of this espionage series, Bourne will hunt down his past in order to find a future. He must travel from Moscow, Paris, Madrid and London to Tangier and New York City as he continues his quest to find the real Jason Bourne--all the while trying to outmaneuver the scores of cops, federal officers and Interpol agents with him in their crosshairs. \n\n\n [b]VIDEO\n\n CodecName:               DivXÃ‚Â® 6.6.1 Codec \n Length:                            1:48:05 Bitrate:                            860 kbps\n FrameRate:\t25 fps\n Width*Height:\t672*284\n\nAUDIO\n\n CodecName:              MP3\n Bitrate:\t\t116 kbps\n Frequency:\t                     44100 Hz\n Channels:\t 2\n[/b]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b362c9dcd022e552370cbf7c259eacfe7ab9c0ec","amp;dn":"THE+BOURNE+ULTIMATUM+%282007%29+DivX%C2%AE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b362c9dcd022e552370cbf7c259eacfe7ab9c0ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,98,201,220,208,34,229,82,55,12,191,124,37,158,172,254,122,185,192,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
