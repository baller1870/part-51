This one is 100% right.\n\n\n&quot;Fresh from his Comeback Special this is Elvis Presley at his peak. A new producer, strong material and one of the best session bands in the country reinvigorated the King. This is unarguably his most consistent post-army work. Outtakes and session recordings have appeared on many bootlegs before - most notably Finding The Way Home - but these have always been somewhat randomly selected and sequenced. For the first time, Purple Chick has gathered together every available piece and compiled a chronological 10CD set. Some of these versions have never appeared on CD before - others will be very familiar.&quot;\n\nRipped at 192 KBps\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07cde16723d75ca4d1e9a7b3a2bad4843a50447e","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+American+Sound","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07cde16723d75ca4d1e9a7b3a2bad4843a50447e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,205,225,103,35,215,92,164,209,233,167,179,162,186,212,132,58,80,68,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
