Includes OS X 10.4 \\\\\\&quot;Tiger\\\\\\&quot;.\nBurn the two disc images using the OS X Disc Utility.\n\nNB: You will need DUAL LAYER burnable DVDs for this. \n\nI will seed about 16 hours a day, for a week or so. The speed will be quite slow at first, so be patient. \n\nAny comments are greatly appreciated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8e08c4e0f732743a9c4897756977e3b0ca40be4","amp;dn":"Macbook+Restore+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8e08c4e0f732743a9c4897756977e3b0ca40be4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,224,140,78,15,115,39,67,169,196,137,119,86,151,126,59,12,164,11,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
