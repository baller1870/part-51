Legally registered as Rutger Hoedemaekers in the city of Amsterdam, The Netherlands, artistically embedded in the forgotten regions of pop music. Being the troublemaker in a self-made realm, About spends his time pounding on the door between band dynamics and consumer electronica, rarely losing track of traditional song structures. \n\nThe intended playfulness in the music does not come from letting the computer do just whatever. It comes from creating every little note and sound by hand, like carefully painting a portrait instead of snapping a polaroid. And while AboutÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½s composed style of singing has you sitting down to think things over, the overpowering arrangement will hurt you if you do. Imagine tasting a stew that smells so good and ending up burning your tongue. \n\nSome 3 years in the making, AboutÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½s debut album ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½BongoÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ forces you to wear yourself out in little over half an hour. Having dealt with 4 collapsed lungs while producing it, Rutger makes good time by giving anyone listening only so much chances to come up for air.

About ready! \n\n============================================ \n\nI personally love this album, and you will too if you like things like: \nAux Raus, Bong-Ra, Goose, LCD Soundsystem and all those other Dance-Punk bands, and if you ever get a change to see him live, TAKE IT! \n______________________________________________________ \nPlease leave a comment on what you think of it or just a thank you is also much appreciated","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae0bdc5d584cd257aec63aa8e820c93a3e0da449","amp;dn":"%5BPPKLP%5D+About+-+Bongo+%282006%29+%5Bvbr%40224kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae0bdc5d584cd257aec63aa8e820c93a3e0da449","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,11,220,93,88,76,210,87,174,198,58,168,232,32,201,58,62,13,164,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
