You can use these files as perfect source material for any audio encoding (even WAV - no loss of quality!). You may not be able to play them, as FLAC is not yet very supported. If so, goto http://www.videolan.org and get the VLC Player. It will play almost everything. For the FLAC stuff goto http://www.xiph.org  - there you will find software and hints needed for transforming the stuff into your desired audio format.\n\nEnjoy and relax. Life is too short. Do not waste it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c69f864334c8ea96df24e5504ec3e38308b788c0","amp;dn":"GOL+-+Sensations+of+Tone+-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c69f864334c8ea96df24e5504ec3e38308b788c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,159,134,67,52,200,234,150,223,36,229,80,78,195,227,131,8,183,136,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
