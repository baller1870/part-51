In the tradition of Joseph Campbell,         \u0019\n \u0018  Michael reveals the origins of the enigmatic Book of Genesis, and  \u0019\n \u0018  the actual hidden significance of religion, yoga, magick, ritual   \u0019\n \u0018  and science. This true meaning has been concealed so that humans   \u0019\n \u0018  remain disempowered and removed from their source. Prayers go      \u0019\n \u0018  unanswered, people remain lost, and humanity heads toward the      \u0019\n \u0018  precipice of oblivion, raping the planet and fighting endlessly.   \u0019\n \u0018  We might ask if it is God or Lucifer who presides over the world,  \u0019\n \u0018  and over the minds of men. Regardless of the miasma and            \u0019\n \u0018  debauchery, the truth of man&amp;#039;s existence remains within the        \u0019\n \u0018  secret traditions. It is now time for ordinary people to have the  \u0019\n \u0018  facts which will make sense of their lives and beliefs. Michael    \u0019\n \u0018  specifies the forces (from within and without) which weigh us      \u0019\n \u0018  down and impede our natural rise, our advancement on all levels.   \u0019\n \u0018                                                                     \u0019\n \u0018  In this captivating and informative presentation, Michael also     \u0019\n \u0018  delves deeply into the gender divide and exposes why it is that    \u0019\n \u0018  the elites within the orthodox religions have debarred women from  \u0019\n \u0018  assuming positions of authority. He also investigates the real     \u0019\n \u0018  reasons for the criminality of mankind, as well as for the rise    \u0019\n \u0018  of technology and science. We learn what it is that really         \u0019\n \u0018  separates man from the primates, and why man is distinguished by   \u0019\n \u0018  his penchant for sadism, cruelty and violence upon members of his  \u0019\n \u0018  own species and upon others.                                       \u0019\n \u0018                                                                     \u0019\n \u0018  Additionally, we are introduced to the &amp;#039;Western Magical            \u0019\n \u0018  Tradition,&amp;#039; and to the meta-sciences employed by the Magi of old   \u0019\n \u0018  to engender psychic hygiene, moral rectitude, and spiritual        \u0019\n \u0018  empowerment. We discover the true hidden connections between the   \u0019\n \u0018  Tarot, the Zodiac, the Kabalistic &amp;#039;Tree of Life&amp;#039; and sacred        \u0019\n \u0018  Numerology.                                                        \u0019\n \u0018                                                                     \u0019\n Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®Ã‚Â®\n\n Ãƒâ€°Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½\u001eÃƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½\u000eÃƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½\u001eÃƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒâ€¹Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â»\n Ã‚Âº                                ÃƒÅ’Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¹\n Ã‚Âº\u0010 C O M M E N T S            \u0011Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â¼ Ã‚Âº\n ÃƒË†Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½ÃƒÅ Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½Ãƒï¿½\u0010\n \u0018                                                                     \u0019\n \u0018  Michael Tsarion is a very knowledgeable and dedicated researcher   \u0019\n \u0018  in many areas.
