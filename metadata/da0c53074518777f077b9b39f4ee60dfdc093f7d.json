Maybe even two. The problem was only 90 minutes of the resulting mess could be used in the feature, leaving almost an hour of movie-worthy s*** on the proverbial cutting room floor.\n\nNot knowing what to do with all this material, Jeff Tremaine and Johnny Knoxville decidedly set it aside for some undecided future use.For the better part of the year following the release of jackass number two, this cache of unseen footage remained in limbo until someone came up with the idea to film all new interviews with the cast, talking about this excess of never-before-seen pranks, stunts, and random acts of behind-the-scenes mischief and stupidity, and package it into a documentary-like feature called jackass 2.5.Although this isn&amp;#039;t necessarily the &quot;new&quot; jackass movie, it&amp;#039;s still every bit as unbelievable, dirty, and downright sexy as its predecessors-maybe even more so at points.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da0c53074518777f077b9b39f4ee60dfdc093f7d","amp;dn":"jack2.5-lpc.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da0c53074518777f077b9b39f4ee60dfdc093f7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,12,83,7,69,24,119,127,7,123,155,57,244,238,96,223,220,9,63,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
