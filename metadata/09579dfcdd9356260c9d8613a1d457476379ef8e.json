However, when he comes across Geert Van Keulen on a deserted beach, he decides to take up his offer on an attempt to hike up one of the tallest mountains on the island. However, when a rockslide pins Warren and prevents him from moving, he must hold out in hopes that Geert will climb down the mountain and return with help, though the rain and rising water level create many more challenges for Warren to overcome.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09579dfcdd9356260c9d8613a1d457476379ef8e","amp;dn":"I.Shouldnt.Be.Alive.S02E01.Trapped.Under.A.Boulder.XViD-DeFaCto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09579dfcdd9356260c9d8613a1d457476379ef8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,87,157,252,221,147,86,38,12,157,134,19,161,212,87,71,99,121,239,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
