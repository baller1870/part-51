It will detect any flying object,identify its type, speed and course, and will track its movement across the whole controlled airspace. You will see this process in real time on your screen as if you were the air traffic control operator.\n\nIf you have two or more monitors connected to your PC, you will be able to configure it to show same or different situations on different displays. This will turn your workplace into something like real airspace observation post. You also will be able to choose display resolution and color quality for each of your monitors and choose which of them should be black while the animation is running.\n\n\nThe Radar Screen saver 1.71 introduces a new function which will make it more useful, allowing you to leave an on-screen message while you are away from your computer. You will be able to create several shortcuts on your desktop or quick launch bar for starting the screen saver quickly in different situations (e.g. lunch, briefing or meeting).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00008f6112909601e4bb3d12dae26c3b9ec1e84a","amp;dn":"Radar+Screensaver+v1.71+Te%40M.DeViL.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00008f6112909601e4bb3d12dae26c3b9ec1e84a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,0,143,97,18,144,150,1,228,187,61,18,218,226,108,59,158,193,232,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
