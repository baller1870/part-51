Falenczyk is sent off to San Francisco where Alcoholics Anonymous awaits, as does Dave (Bill Pullman), who helps Frank get an apartment and a job in a mortuary. The job introduces Frank to Laurel (TÃƒÂ©a Leoni), whom he begins a relationship with while occasionally falling off the wagon and attending AA meetings. Wonderful performances from Ben Kingsley and TÃƒÂ©a Leoni. You Kill Me is a charming, funny take on the familiar inner-lives-of-hit-men premise.\n\nCast: Ben Kingsley, TÃƒÂ©a Leoni, Luke Wilson, Bill Pullman, Dennis Farina\n\nVideo = (E)\nAudio = (E)\n\n\n\nPlease be Kind and Seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3db7248bcb4a374390f9dd02dc2f7fca4c9149c4","amp;dn":"Double+Feature%3A%3A-+Stardust+%26+You+Kill+Me+RMVB+%5BRpM%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3db7248bcb4a374390f9dd02dc2f7fca4c9149c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,183,36,139,203,74,55,67,144,249,221,2,220,47,127,202,76,145,73,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
