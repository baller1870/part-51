Their expectations of survival or rescue are bleak. Only four of the crew survive, one of whom is barely alive. After he dies, the three remaining men, Corey, Donlin, and Pierson decide to trek out into the barren desert to see if there is anything ? shelter, water ? that might improve their chances of survival. When Corey and Donlin reconvene, it seems that Pierson is dead and Corey filched the water supply from his dead body. Donlin, the commanding officer, forces Corey at gunpoint to lead him to Pierson&amp;#039;s body. They find Pierson, still barely alive, who with his last bit of strength draws a primitive diagram in the sand with his finger. Corey then kills Donlin and sets out alone, confident that he will survive longer now that he has all of the water supply. After wandering aimlessly for an extended period, he sees a set of power lines and realizes that that&amp;#039;s what Pierson was attempting to draw. A highway and road signs reveal that the ship crashed on Earth and the men had been in the Nevada desert the entire time.\n\nMP4 Format for your IPOD \n\nPLEASE SEED! \n\nEnjoy! \n\nAntil0ck\n\n_______       ______________________      ______  \n___    |________  /___(_)__  /_  __ ________  /__\n__  /| |_  __   __/_  /__  /_  / / /  ___/_  //_/\n_  ___ |  / / / /_ _  / _  / / /_/ // /__ _  ,&lt;   \n/_/  |_/_/ /_/__/ /_/  /_/  ____/ ___/ /_/|_| ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a72c2cde1943a24a6c52830a1952d531733ef473","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+Episode+15+-+I+shot+an+arrow+into+the+air","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a72c2cde1943a24a6c52830a1952d531733ef473","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,44,44,222,25,67,162,74,108,82,131,10,25,82,213,49,115,62,244,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
