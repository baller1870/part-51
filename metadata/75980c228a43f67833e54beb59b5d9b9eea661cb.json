This is a quality download, unlike the shitty repacks MotherHen puts out.  I mean, who uploads a torrent of a game when they don\\&amp;#039;t even know if it\\&amp;#039;s selfboot?\n          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.segahub.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.segahub.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInformation\nSelfboot: Yes\nNTSC: Yes\nOriginal RARs: Yes\n\nIf you\\&amp;#039;re looking for that rush of nostalgia that only 2D-scrolling shooters like GALAGA and GRADIUS can bring, then MARS MATRIX from Capcom may be the game for you. The year is 2309, and a Martian colony has revolted against Earth\\&amp;#039;s government. You are a member of Earth\\&amp;#039;s Defense Force and have been sent to the Red planet to quell the Martian rebellion. You\\&amp;#039;ll have to pilot your Mosquito ship in a solo battle against waves of enemies in your frantic bid for survival. Fly as fast as you can, zipping in front of and behind backgrounds and buildings as the colorful but deadly projectiles rain down on your ever-changing position. Fly quickly and grab valuable power-ups that will upgrade your craft\\&amp;#039;s standard weapon. You also have your handy pulse cannon and powerful Mosquito attack to assist you; the Mosquito attack sucks up all enemy bullets on-screen and spits them back out in an opponent-blasting explosion. The graphics in MARS MATRIX are bright, well-animated 2D sprites that look good (albeit in an old-style manner) and help to keep the pace blistering without any pesky slowdown.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75980c228a43f67833e54beb59b5d9b9eea661cb","amp;dn":"Mars+Matrix+%5BSEGAHUB.ORG%5D+%5Bselfboot%5D+%28dc+dreamcast%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75980c228a43f67833e54beb59b5d9b9eea661cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,152,12,34,138,67,246,120,51,229,75,235,89,181,217,185,238,166,97,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
