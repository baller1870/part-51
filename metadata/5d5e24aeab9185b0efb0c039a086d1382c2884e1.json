It&amp;#039;s mainly a guitar record, but with diverse influences and a bizarre feeling to the music. There are 6 original songs and two more songs which are covers of long gone eighties classics such as the original &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; intro theme - &quot;High Upon This Love&quot; by Jack Allocco and David Kurtz, together with a fresh interpretation of the Super Mario Bros theme (by Koji Kondo), completely executed on the electric bass.\n\nFor more informations: www.simmessa.com/blog, www.simmessa.com/twoo\n\nMyspace (sucks): myspace.com/simmessa","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d5e24aeab9185b0efb0c039a086d1382c2884e1","amp;dn":"Simmessa+-+The+Way+of+Opening+-+2008.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d5e24aeab9185b0efb0c039a086d1382c2884e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,94,36,174,171,145,133,176,239,176,192,57,160,134,209,56,44,40,132,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
