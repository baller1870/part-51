The book, published by Olive Branch Press (Interlink), contains eleven essays by American and international intellectuals. Ray McGovern, the host of the event commented that these writings ?in no way can be dismissed as the ravings of ?paranoid conspiracy theorists.??\n\nThe video of this landmark event publicizing 9/11 Truth, includes the complete presentations of each of four major contributors to the book: David Ray Griffin, Peter Dale Scott, Peter Phillips and Kevin Ryan plus question and answer moderated by host Ray McGovern.
