With its sophisticated Vajrayana traditions and primary emphasis on compassion, Tibetan culture has been blessed with a spiritual expanse as vast as the windswept passes and mountains of its terrain. \n\nSequestered amid the arid elevations of the Greater Tibetan Plateau, Tibet\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Buddhist culture flourished in an unusual isolation well into the 20th century, spawning an outpouring of spiritual practice and philosophy the West has discovered only recently. But Tibet\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s removal from neighboring conflicts came to an abrupt end when the Chinese Communists invaded in the 1950\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s. \n\nFaced with the increasingly radicalized policies of the Chinese occupation, the Dalai Lama was forced to flee Tibet for India in 1959, making a political refugee of the leader of the Tibetan people. And so began a term of exile and occupation that continues for all Tibetans to this day. \n\nThe physical impact of China\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s policies in Tibet has been both incompletely documented and appalling: 1.2 million Tibetans have died as a result of the occupation. Over 6,000 monasteries have been destroyed, as a systematic influx of Chinese settlers has threatened to make Tibetans a minority on their own land. Meanwhile, most of Tibet\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s spiritual practices have been made forcibly illegal for decades. \n\nWhile a growing segment of the world community has learned about and sympathized with the plight of Tibet in recent years, persecution there, both cultural and religious, still continues.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a6a349f46aec8127b86c344dd422954c165b967","amp;dn":"Yungchen+Lhamo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a6a349f46aec8127b86c344dd422954c165b967","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,106,52,159,70,174,200,18,123,134,195,68,221,66,41,84,193,101,185,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
