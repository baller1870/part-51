Fortunately, NovellÃ‚Â® now offers a better way to do more with fewer resources. You can cut costs dramatically?and provide new, profit-turning client services?by implementing Novell NetWare 6.5. \n\nNetWare 6.5 is the most reliable client services platform for delivering secure, non-stop access to network and information resources. It protects your existing technology investments and provides an easier, more consistent way to integrate business systems and services. With NetWare 6.5, you also have an open, flexible foundation. You can adapt quickly to new business requirements, manage and deploy your own Web services and enhance the productivity of all employees. A NetWare 6.5 license entitles you to a 250,000-user license of Novell eDirectory and numerous other benefits, many of which are outlined in the following service areas: \n\nNetWare Client Services: Business-Continuity and Consolidation \nServer downtime and system vulnerability are not options for your organization. You need a network that secures and consolidates critical resources, keeping them available 24x7 and manageable from any location. NetWare 6.5 provides such a network and includes many cost-reducing tools and services. For example, with NetWare 6.5, you can do the following: \nCreate a cost-effective, intelligent consolidation strategy through iSCSI support, updated clustering services and a time-saving server-consolidation utility \nConsolidate branch offices and reduce operating expenses with Novell Branch Office* \nSimplify the consolidation and upgrade process by automatically moving your data and data attributes from older versions of NetWare or Windows NT to your updated NetWare 6.5 environment \nManage mixed environments?without administrative and security headaches?using DirXML** Starter Pack (drivers for Microsoft Active Directory to eDirectory, Windows NT domains to eDirectory, and eDirectory to eDirectory, along with password synchronization) \nEnsure that your IT staff is effective and efficient?from any location?through the Web-based management features in iManager \nImplement a cost-effective disaster-recovery strategy with Novell Cluster Services, GEO site failover, Novell Branch Office and iFolder \nWith these included tools and services, you can keep critical systems running at all times and provide 100-percent failover to a remote site in the event of a disaster or emergency. This means that your irreplaceable data is stored in multiple locations and cannot be lost or destroyed if your main data center goes down. In addition, you can save time and money by consolidating servers, simplifying the management of mixed environments and using convenient Web-based administration tools. \n\nNetWare Client Services: Open-Source, Standards-Based Services \nYou&amp;#039;ve recognized the value of open-source strategies and standards-based solutions: easier integration, faster development cycles and maximum flexibility to meet evolving business demands. NetWare 6.5 delivers the technology you need to create and manage your own open-source solutions, without sacrificing reliability or increasing management costs. Specifically, you can use NetWare 6.5 to do the following: \n\nMaintain flexibility through support for open-source technologies?including Apache, MySQL, Perl, PHP and Tomcat \nSimplify the management of open-source projects and standards-based technologies through the intuitive, browser-based iManager \nRun and modify J2EE applications \nUse and protect existing systems, while allowing application portability \nThe open-source, standards-based services in NetWare 6.5 help you protect your existing technology investments. As you need to modify systems and applications, you can do so with open-source tools that are included in NetWare 6.5 or offered on the Web. You&amp;#039;ll also enjoy the ability to integrate and modify resources at a moment&amp;#039;s notice: you won&amp;#039;t have to purchase new software or approach an outside vendor to get the work done. \n\nWeb Application Development and Services \nNetWare 6.5 transforms your network into a Web services powerhouse. Highly scalable and easy to use, the exteNd family of products provides the most complete foundation for rapidly building and deploying cross-platform J2EE and Web applications. With the Web application development services in NetWare 6.5, you can do the following: \n\nRun any J2EE-compliant application, including proprietary and open-source applications, on exteNd Application Server \nSave time and money by deploying J2EE applications and running them on the NetWare platform \nCreate new J2EE applications in the visual-development environment offered by Novell exteNd Workbench \nUsing NetWare 6.5, you can deploy and manage any applications based on Java and other open Web-services standards. You can also develop these types of applications with Novell exteNd Workbench, an included visual-development environment that accelerates productivity and development cycles. \n\nNetWare Client Services: Virtual Office \nNow your employees can stay connected and productive from any location. NetWare 6.5 includes many Virtual Office services that enable users to remotely access and manage information and resources whether they&amp;#039;re traveling, working from home or visiting a branch office. The following Virtual Office services are just a sampling of what&amp;#039;s available in NetWare 6.5: \n\nAccess personal files from anywhere, using iFolder \nQuickly locate employees and contact information through eGuide \nEnjoy self-service, Internet-based printing with iPrint \nGive users a familiar interface through Novell Network Attached Storage Protocols \nOrganize, locate and securely share information in real time through Virtual Teams \nImprove efficiency and reduce IT expenses by giving users control over password and personal-information management, printer setup and Web-page creation \nWith these services your employees have browser-based access to everything they need to stay productive. And because end users can manage their own passwords and printing, IT personnel will have much more time to focus on strategic projects and planning. \n\nThe NetWare AMP Solution includes: \nApache 2.0.45 \nMySQL* 4.0.21 \nPerl 5.8 \nPHP 4.2.3 \nTomcat 4.1.18 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b45fc34f45429cce884fd7695ab310415bdbaec","amp;dn":"Novell%C2%AE+NetWare%C2%AE+for+Windows+%28%2415.399%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b45fc34f45429cce884fd7695ab310415bdbaec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,69,252,52,244,84,41,204,232,132,253,118,149,171,49,4,21,189,186,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
