The label is dedicated to all forms of experimental music, but mainly the drone, noise, free jazz and ambient/glitch styles. Most releases can be downloaded on the label homepage, but here they are all compiled (together with the original .pdf\\&amp;#039;s) for your pleasure and convenience. And it\\&amp;#039;s totally legal, since these releases are under creative commons.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hwem.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hwem.net&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nWe Were Dancing - In A Simulated Sense Of Loss [hwemnet001]\n\n\nQuote:\nInspired by everyday situations and faded memories of total happiness, We Were Dancing uses distorted sounds, noise and lo-fi field recordings to create rare little soundscapes. Music for 06 and beyond!\n\n\n1 I Can\\&amp;#039;t Recall How Love Feels, Memory Fails To Remind Me (2:57)\n2 The Pieces That Were Left (5:14)\n3 Fragile (5:45)\n\n\n\nKaburu  - If He Is; We Are Not [hwemnet002]\n\n\nQuote:\nAfter releasing hours of free music on the internet and playing several shows at venues ranging from art museums to punk clubs it is now time for their first official release. With this 30-minute free-form piece entitled \\&quot;If he is; We are not\\&quot; they are playing with conventional conceptions of art, human nature and the world.\n\n\n1 If He Is; We Are Not (29:33)\n\n\n\nSekvens  - Live In Moskva [hwemnet003]\n\n\nQuote:\nIn august 2006 Martin Herterich headed for Russia to play a show at Electroclub in beautiful Moscow. The session was recorded, and HWEM is now proud to present it here in its entirety.\n\n\n1 Part 1 (Barrikadnaja) (12:16)\n2 Part 2 (Arbatskaja) (11:37)\n\n\n\nMilitant Fields / We Were Dancing / Dead Letters Spell Out Dead Words  - 80.39 [hwemnet004]\n\n\nQuote:\nHwem is re-releasing Militant Fields 80.39 EP together with remixes from Dead Letters Spell Out Dead Words, We Were Dancing and Militant Fields himself. 80.39 has been described as a hiccup of the Eraserhead soundtrack. Slow panning soundscapes inhales and exhales. Rumbling noise tells stories of unhappy times.\n\n\n1 Militant Fields - 80.39 (11:10)\n2 Militant Fields - And Then I Cried (5:13)\n3 We Were Dancing - Switching Keys On A Militant Field (5:23)\n4 Dead Letters Spell Out Dead Words - No Words #15 (10:37)\n\n\n\nWe Were Dancing  - Mixtape Vol. 1 - We Won\\&amp;#039;t Get Old [hwemnet005]\n\n\nQuote:\nOn \\&quot;Mixtape vol.1 - we wonÃ‚Â´t get old\\&quot;, We Were Dancing continues to explore soundscapes built of distorted sounds and lo-fi field sessions. This release should really be listened to in the crappiest little boomblaster you can find. Hi-Fi is for the bourgeois!\n\n\n1 Eaten By The Sea/Simrishamnsgatan (4:24)\n2 We Were Singin\\&amp;#039; (Alcohol Edit) (4:38)\n3 We Won\\&amp;#039;t (Pt. 1) (8:04)\n4 We Won\\&amp;#039;t (Pt. 2) (4:05)\n5 We Could Hide In There, For Winter (4:48)\n6 Our Childhood Memories, Beneath Incomplete Buildings, Tourism And Commerce (3:52)\n7 I\\&amp;#039;m Waking Up To Us (4:53)\n\n\n\nMartin Herterich - Recordings 070401-070521\n\n\nQuote:\n\\&quot;On this record, I wanted to explore the possibilities of the grand piano as a droning instrument. By pitching, timestretching and processing piano samples, I sometimes try to make the piano sound more like a bowed string instrument. But the record is also supposed to be a snapshot, taken a cloudy day somewhere near a harbour.\\&quot; - Martin Herterich\n\n\n1 The Harbour In Rain (Morning) (6:32)\n2 Slow Dance (4:41)\n3 The Harbour In Rain (Evening) (2:37)\n4 Asleep/Awake (11:28)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f210f0ee8d34b044e6fa089ce23f85e640095a9","amp;dn":"Hwem+-+Complete+Label+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f210f0ee8d34b044e6fa089ce23f85e640095a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,33,15,14,232,211,75,4,78,111,160,137,206,35,248,94,100,0,149,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
