Who sells the best Cheesesteak? The intense--but always comical--rhetoric between fans of rival eateries is chronicled here. (13 minutes)  -Scott Vosbury.\n\nThe second short swings wildly around in a light-hearted direction. The Great Cheesesteak Debate starts off hackneyed, but also fun and brisk, a man-on-the-street chronicling Philadelphians&amp;#039; intense opinions on who makes the best cheesesteak. The short quickly becomes repetitive with endless shots of people saying either &quot;Geno&amp;#039;s&quot; or &quot;Pat&amp;#039;s.&quot; My initial suspicions that this wasn&amp;#039;t going to be much more than a Food Network segment proved prescient. -Michael Buening at http://popmatters.com/film/reviews/f/full-frame-documetary-shorts-vol-3.shtml\n\n\nBuening writes like a pompous ass. This is a great flick throughout, and if you find that a very amusing 13 minutes of movie-watching has become &quot;repetitive&quot; then your attention has become warped by all your first person shooter video games and daily diet of Super Gulp cokes. It&amp;#039;s comical. It&amp;#039;s short. It&amp;#039;s worth it. -Kibbles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89e70fdd076e5e1f638a063f79a0991a76f64a06","amp;dn":"The+Great+Cheesesteak+Debate+of+Philadelphia.divx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89e70fdd076e5e1f638a063f79a0991a76f64a06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,231,15,221,7,110,94,31,99,138,6,63,121,160,153,26,118,246,74,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
