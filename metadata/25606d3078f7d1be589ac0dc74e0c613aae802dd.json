After learning of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, these ordinary civilians chose to fight back against the terrorists. The courageous revolt ultimately led to the deadly crash in a Shanksville, Pennsylvania field, just 20 air minutes from Washington. The passengers\\&amp;#039; actions likely prevented the plane from being used as a guided missile to destroy the U.S. Capitol or the White House. \nBased on fully annotated facts from the public record, this heart-pounding movie includes the extraordinary communications that took place between the doomed passengers and their loved ones on the ground. It covers the horrifying scenarios discussed by U.S. military and government officials as they prepared to shoot down the plane, if necessary. And it reveals the helpless efforts of other pilots in the air and air traffic controllers as everyone scrambled to understand events and react.\nFLIGHT 93 stars Jeffrey Nordling as Tom Burnett, Ty Olsson as Mark Bingham, Brennan Elliott as Todd Beamer, Colin Glazer as Jeremy Glick and Kendall Cross as Deena Burnett.* \n\n[size=4][color=red]SISTEMA[/color][/size] \n\n{x}PAL {}NTSC \n\n\n[size=4][color=red]ASPECTO+FORMATO DE SUBIDA[/color][/size] \n\n{} fullscreen (4:3) {} Widescreen (16:9) {} letterbox (1.66:1) {} otro xxx \n{} fulldvd-9 {x} fulldvd-r {} jmdvd {} otro xxx \n\n\n[size=4][color=red]AUDIO+IDIOMA[/color][/size] \n\n{x} Ingles {x} Castellano {} FrancÃƒÂ©s {} AlemÃƒÂ¡n {} Otros: xx \n\n{x} Dolby Digital 5.1 {} DTS {} Estereo \n\n\n[size=4][color=red]COMPRESION[/color][/size] {}si {x}no \n\n{}rebuilder + ... {} CCE(pasadas) {} HC \n{}shrink {}clonedvd {}otro xxx \n\nvideo bitrate {} \nmenu {x} si {} no \nextras * * \nEliminado * * \n\n[size=4][color=red]SUBTITULOS[/color][/size] \n\n{x} InglÃƒÂ©s {x} EspaÃƒÂ±ol {} FrancÃƒÂ©s {} AlemÃƒÂ¡n {} Otros \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25606d3078f7d1be589ac0dc74e0c613aae802dd","amp;dn":"FLIGHT+93","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25606d3078f7d1be589ac0dc74e0c613aae802dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,96,109,48,120,247,209,190,88,154,192,220,116,224,198,19,170,232,2,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
