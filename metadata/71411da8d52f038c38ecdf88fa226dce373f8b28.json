Sound quality varies widely, but all is at least 320 kb:\n\nAmbient Egypt -- New Age synthesizers mixed with ancient cymbals and string instruments. Not period correct, but very soothing.\n\nAncient Egypt -- a reconstruction of his ancestors&amp;#039; music by a renowned modern Arab musician.\n\nAncient Sumerians/Egyptians/Greeks -- a reconstruction of the few fragments of actual music that survived the ancient world, played on period instruments.\n\nAnkh -- another interpretation of ancient Egyptian music and song.\n\nMusic from Ancient Rome -- this folder contains the tracks for both of Synaulia&amp;#039;s CD&amp;#039;s, one each for string and wind instruments.\n\nEnjoy! And if you like what you hear, please do support the artists and buy the CD&amp;#039;s!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71411da8d52f038c38ecdf88fa226dce373f8b28","amp;dn":"Music+of+the+Ancient+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71411da8d52f038c38ecdf88fa226dce373f8b28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,65,29,168,213,47,3,140,56,236,223,136,250,34,109,206,55,63,139,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
