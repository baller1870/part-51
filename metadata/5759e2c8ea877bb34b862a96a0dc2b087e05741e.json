The .mkv has DD5.1/ac3 audio at 448 kbps; this .m4v has AAC stereo audio at 160 kbps. The surround capabilities are noteworthy, but not always at the expense of video quality (the MP4 has more room for video). Chapters markers are included in both, but the .mkv may contain incorrect data; neither contain subtitles of any kind.\n\n\nWith Perian, Quicktime (including iTunes and AppleTV) should play the .mkv file flawlessly.\nMPlayer, VLC, etc. should all handle the file without issue.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5759e2c8ea877bb34b862a96a0dc2b087e05741e","amp;dn":"Transformers+SE+DVD+x264%3ADD5.1+Rip+MKV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5759e2c8ea877bb34b862a96a0dc2b087e05741e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,89,226,200,234,135,123,179,75,134,42,150,160,220,43,8,126,5,116,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
