Owned by multi-millionaire Barry Larson and costing Ã‚Â£8,000 a week to run, the place boasted top French chef Loic LeFebvre and an impeccably-trained kitchen staff, all of them on a mission to bring sophisticated French cooking to the home of the haggis.\n\nBut the locals weren&amp;#039;t biting and the restaurant was empty most nights. Gordon&amp;#039;s recipe for survival forced them to tone down their act and demystify the menu to get the punters in. Today the restaurant&amp;#039;s return to form has led to plans for expansion. Loic is still there, and now he&amp;#039;s been promoted to executive chef he will oversee any new ventures. But can he continue to resist a return to French frills, and has he managed to pull off his own personal ambition, a Michelin star?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48c1a2c91755d9eca45b00aacbc8a9e6b96ec235","amp;dn":"Ramsays.Kitchen.Nightmares.S04E05.WS.PDTV.XviD-REMAX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48c1a2c91755d9eca45b00aacbc8a9e6b96ec235","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,193,162,201,23,85,217,236,164,91,0,170,203,200,169,230,185,110,194,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
