During its service the cockpit has evolved from a completely analog panel to a majority glass panel. This panel package includes all 3 versions of the MD-80 including a totally Analog panel, a combination glass Primary Flight and Nav displays with Analog engine instruments, and Majority Glass panel.\n\nTwo other panel configurations include the Glass panel with a standard annunciator panel, and the Combination glass/analog panel without a GPS for a total of five panel configurations.\n\nEach panel is completely unique, with all its own instruments and annunciator panels. Fly one leg in the old school configuration and then jump in the glass panel. There is a configuration for every simmer.\n\nAnother very exciting feature of this add-on is the cooperation of JCA and their superb MD-80 model. This panel has been specifically designed for use with the JCA MD-80. Also included are the files necessary to incorporate the excellent TCAS gauge by Lee Hetherington. These partnerships will allow us to provide a realistic panel package with five totally separate configurations and tons of features at a great price.
