Cronos quit Venom after disappointing sales of the Calm Before The Storm album, and he took with him Venom&amp;#039;s two guitarists, Mike Hickey and James Clare. They operated somewhat sparsely until Venom&amp;#039;s reunion in 1995, which naturally signaled the split of the band.\n\nCronos released two albums, Dancing In The Fire (1990) and Rock &amp;#039;N&amp;#039; Roll Disease (1991). A third album entitled Triumvirate was planned to be released in 1996, but this was cancelled because of Venom&amp;#039;s reunion. Instead, three tracks from this unreleased album was included in the Cronos complilation album Venom which came out in 1995. This complilation also included tracks from the two first albums + re-recorded versions of some classic Venom tracks.     \n\nMusicwise, Cronos had a somewhat more straightahead metal sound when compared to Venom, and to a certain extent it was also a bit more melodic and &quot;experimental&quot;. In addition to this, Cronos did actually sing on some of the tracks, and that with a great singing voice too.\n\n\nIncluded here are the following three albums:\n\nDancing In The Fire (1990)  (MP3 192 kbps)\nRock &amp;#039;N&amp;#039; Roll Disease (1991)  (MP3 128 kbps)\nVenom (1995)  (MP3 128 kbps)\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nLinks: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronos_%28band%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronos_%28band%29&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rockdetector.com/artist,1975.sm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rockdetector.com/artist,1975.sm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=564&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=564&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bnrmetal.com/groups/cron.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bnrmetal.com/groups/cron.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAs with all my MP3 torrents, all files are properly named &amp; tagged.\n\nCheck out my other torrents here:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/user/ElgerHz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/user/ElgerHz&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddda3b7e83f3a173bf8b78cbd9ee033c670144ce","amp;dn":"Cronos+-+3+Albums+%28Metal%29+%5BElgerHz%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddda3b7e83f3a173bf8b78cbd9ee033c670144ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,218,59,126,131,243,161,115,191,139,120,203,217,238,3,60,103,1,68,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
