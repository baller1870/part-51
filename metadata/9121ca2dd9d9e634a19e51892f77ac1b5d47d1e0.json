From the makers of Shall We Dance? and Waterboys comes Swing Girls, an inspirational zero-to-hero tale about a group of girls who find their rhythm - and then some! Tomoko (Ueno Juri) leads a group of bored girls stuck in remedial summer math class, who decide to ditch their boring teacher (Takenaka Naoto) to deliver lunches to the school brass band.\n\nBut the girls\\&amp;#039; extreme laziness causes the lunches to spoil, and soon nearly the entire brass band gets sick. The remaining member is Takuo (Hiraoka Yuto), who recruits Tomoko\\&amp;#039;s classmate Sekiguchi (Motokariya Yuika) into the band, even though Sekiguchi\\&amp;#039;s musical talents are entirely in question. But Tomoko and the other girls soon follow, partly to get out of math class, and partly because it\\&amp;#039;s their fault that the entire band got sick in the first place! But there\\&amp;#039;s a catch: nobody knows how to play a wind or brass instrument, much to the dismay of Takuo, who proposes that the girls play swing band jazz - and take their act all the way to a battle-of-the-bands finale! Will the girls find a way to swing like tested jazz musicians, or will they discover that maybe math isn\\&amp;#039;t so bad?\n\nDirected by Yaguchi Shinobu (Waterboys), Swing Girls struck a chord with audiences thanks to its feel-good emotions and energetic cast of young girls, and ranked eighth at the Japanese box office for 2004. Like the characters they play, many of the actors were strangers to their instruments when filming began, and learned to play as filming went on! Full of humor, heart, and more than a little satisfying irreverence, Swing Girls is a toe-tapping, crowd-pleasing good time at the movies!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9121ca2dd9d9e634a19e51892f77ac1b5d47d1e0","amp;dn":"Swing.Girls.2004.DVDRip.XviD-TLF%5BJapanese%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9121ca2dd9d9e634a19e51892f77ac1b5d47d1e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,33,202,45,217,217,230,52,161,158,81,137,47,119,172,27,93,71,209,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
