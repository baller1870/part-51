Nevertheless, is has been hacked, and now Linux can be run on it. This presentation consists of two parts.\n\nIn the first part, we describe the motivation and the design of the Xbox 360 security system from a very high-legel point of view, present the hack and what is possible with Linux, and discuss how the situation can be improved both for the manufacturer and for hobbyists with future devices.\n\nIn the second, very technical part, we will discuss the design and implementation details of the Xbox 360 system and security architecture and describe in detail how and why it was hacked, as well as how Linux was ported to this new platform.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb0168f6d6970ea5b2604eb33efd63f8b2ba4fc8","amp;dn":"24c3-2279-en-deconstructing_xbox_360_security.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb0168f6d6970ea5b2604eb33efd63f8b2ba4fc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,1,104,246,214,151,14,165,178,96,78,179,62,253,99,248,178,186,79,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
