John Levine, who originated the music, says that he entered an entranced state where he had no recollection of the physical act of creation. This condition is well known today as a state of &quot;flow&quot;: the creator works from a place where they&amp;#039;re using their strongest skills to produce work that truly reflects their gifts and vision. \n\nDEMO: http://www.silenceofmusic.com/MP3/heart.mp3\n\n\nWEBSITE: http://www.silenceofmusic.com/alphamusic.html\n\nmeditation, meditative, relax","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac4e15657985e7a1db0ffb9fb9c7af3aba51626d","amp;dn":"Silence+of+heart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac4e15657985e7a1db0ffb9fb9c7af3aba51626d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,78,21,101,121,133,231,161,219,15,251,159,185,199,175,58,186,81,98,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
