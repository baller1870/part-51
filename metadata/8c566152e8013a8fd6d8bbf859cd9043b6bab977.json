They burrowed underground, creating caverns ben- Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ eath the  earth to re-establish their  civilization. It was a Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ major  undertaking,  but  they managed  to save  five million Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ Sproinklings before the surface was reduced to smithereens.   Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦                                                               Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ It has been many years since, and now the little green aliens Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ have run  out of supplies. This planet appears  to have reco- Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ vered, so it is time to venture back to the surface &amp; collect Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ the  food that  the beings  desperately  need. But  there&amp;#039;s a Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ problem : the  caverns are  caving in. You  must clear a safe Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ path  for the  five  million Sproinklings. Are you  up to the Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ challenge ?                                                   Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦                                                               Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ The road is arduous and there will be Sproinkling fatalities. Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ It  is nearly  impossible to save  all  of your  fellow green Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ aliens, so  you  must do  your  best to rescue as many as you Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ possibly  can. Along  the  way, you  will  encounter  several Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ obstacles  and  challenges that will  make your rescue effort Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ more difficult.                                               Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦                                                               Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ In some stages, if not  enough progress is  made, your bridge Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ will rise  a level or  two. This gives you less space to work Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ with.                                                         Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦                                                               Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ Don&amp;#039;t bump  your head. If  the two  Sproinkets  operating the Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ cart hit  their heads on  the overhanging  crystals, they can Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ sometimes  cause an  avalanche. Many,  many stones  will fall Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ from  above, and  you will  have a difficult  time collecting Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ them  all before  they attack  your bridge. When  the  bridge Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ snaps, you lose a life.                                       Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦                                                               Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ Rounded bridges can make aiming more difficult. The  angle of Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ the road affects the angle of your shot, so bare that in mind Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ when you encounter bridges that are bowed in the center.      Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦                                                               Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ Special  items are  sometimes dropped  from  above by  flying Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ vehicles. Most of these are to your advantage -- giving you a Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ drill  tool, rockets, and  additional  bridge supports -- but Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ some can  be quite  detrimental. They  may narrow  your  cart Ã‚Â¦\n     Ã‚Â¦ opening or damage your wheels. Be careful what you collect.
