Their first musicvideo which have been long waited for, by this rising underground band which has shaken the very foundations of metal. \n\nMachinae Supremacy is a band located in northern Sweden playing the musical style &quot;Sid-Metal&quot;. In short - A mix of metal and tones made by a &quot;computerchip&quot; (Commodore 64) making the sound to be reqognized in, for example Super nintendo games. Dont let that explanation make you take this band unseriously. This is very real epic music that could blow you away. \n\n\nBand: Machinae Supremacy\nRecord company: Spinefarm Records\nSong title: Through The Looking Glass\nAlbum: Redeemer (2006)\n\nI wish you all to support this band. Truly under rated band, MANY, Then i mean VERY MANY - other bands that gain attention in masses Isn&amp;#039;t half as good as this band. I have never heard a song by this band that hasn&amp;#039;t moved me.
