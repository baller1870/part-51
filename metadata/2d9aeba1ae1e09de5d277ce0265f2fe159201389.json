Deckadance comes from Image-Line, publisher who stands behind well known DAW application - FL Studio. Personally, i like Deckadance?s native support for most of hardware/midi controllers such as Behringer BCD2000/3000 series, Vestax VCI-100, and so on. No matter if you?re a hobby DJ or pro, give it a try. Also i must quote Image-Line: ?Of course, if you suck as a DJ, you will still suck using Deckadance, but you will suck better, faster, harder and more creatively than ever before!?  ;-)\n\nDeckadance is a DJ mixing application that works either as a standalone program OR as a VSTi plugin inside your favourite host. Deckadance itself can also host any VST compliant softsynth or effect.\n\nYou can control Deckadance (Club Edition) using most (if not all) existing midi controllers &amp; timecoded vinyl and CD systems.\n\nRelease Name: Deckadance.1.14.Club.Edition-TSRH\nSize: 37.9MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d9aeba1ae1e09de5d277ce0265f2fe159201389","amp;dn":"Deckadance+1.14+Club+Edition-TSRH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d9aeba1ae1e09de5d277ce0265f2fe159201389","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,154,235,161,174,30,9,222,93,39,124,224,38,95,47,225,89,32,19,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
