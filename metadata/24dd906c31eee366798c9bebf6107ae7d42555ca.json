In this way, DVDFab will ignore unplayable content which may contain copy protection. \n\nPlease note when \\&quot;PathPlayer\\&quot; is enabled, opening a DVD may need up to several minutes, which is much longer than before. \nNew: Added setting options for \\&quot;PathPlayer\\&quot;. \nNew: Added support for a new copy protection as found on \\&quot;Blade: House of Chthon\\&quot;, (US). \nNew: Added support for a new copy protection as found on \\&quot;88 Minutes\\&quot;, (R2, German). \nNew: Added support for a new copy protection as found on \\&quot;Bridge to Terabithia\\&quot;, (R2, German). \nNew: Added support for a new copy protection as found on \\&quot;Curse of the Golden Flower\\&quot;, (R2, UK). \nNew: Removed unreferenced VTS and PGC for cleaner DVD structure and better compression. \nNew: Brand new \\&quot;DVD to Mobile\\&quot; framework which gives DVDFab the ability to take the power of dual core (or more cores) CPU.
