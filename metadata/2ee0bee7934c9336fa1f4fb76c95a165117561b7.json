With a total of 20 tracks and freestyles from Gillie Da Kid, this \nmixtape features his Major Figga family (Bump J, Ab Liva, Dutch &amp; Spade) plus a special appearance from 50 Cent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ee0bee7934c9336fa1f4fb76c95a165117561b7","amp;dn":"VA-Superstar_Jay_And_Gillie_Da_Kid-The_Truth_Hurts-%28Bootleg%29-200","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ee0bee7934c9336fa1f4fb76c95a165117561b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,224,190,231,147,76,147,54,250,31,79,183,108,149,161,101,17,117,97,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
