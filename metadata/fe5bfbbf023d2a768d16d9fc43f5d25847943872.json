Nobody in town likes the traveling Gypsies much, so Halleck&amp;#039;s pals -- a judge and a cop -- cover up the incident. After the cover-up, the dead woman&amp;#039;s father, Tadzu Lempke (Michael Constantine), touches Halleck&amp;#039;s face and whispers &quot;thinner.&quot; Pretty soon, Halleck is losing weight at an incredible rate of more than 40 pounds a week. He tries everything, but learns that Lempke is the only man who can remove the curse. In the meantime, the judge dies of a mysterious skin ailment, and the cop commits suicide. When begging and pleading with Lempke doesn&amp;#039;t work, Halleck turns to more drastic methods of persuasion. \n\nmore details: www.solodvd.org\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe5bfbbf023d2a768d16d9fc43f5d25847943872","amp;dn":"The+Thinner+Stephen+King","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe5bfbbf023d2a768d16d9fc43f5d25847943872","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,91,251,191,2,61,42,118,141,22,217,252,67,245,210,88,71,148,56,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
