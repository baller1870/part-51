It does NOTHING malicious.  NO other changes were made.\n\nNOTICE: For version 8.1.0178.00.  View Help -&gt; About to check yours.  Not tested on any other version, and may prevent other versions from running.  If you want to try it anyway, make a backup of your &quot;msgsres.dll&quot; file to restore, just in case.\n\n-----\n\n1. Make sure Messenger is closed completely and not running in the system tray.\n\n2. Extract to the program directory (ex: C:\\Program Files\\MSN Messenger\\), overwriting the original &quot;msgsres.dll&quot;.\n\n3. Enjoy your freedom from ads.\n\n4. If a new version comes out, email me and I&amp;#039;ll make a new patched DLL.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:523471efe05d9ca025556f8105259b698b07c6f6","amp;dn":"Windows+Live+Messenger+Ad+Removal+%28MSN+Messenger%29+v8.1.0178.00","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"523471efe05d9ca025556f8105259b698b07c6f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,52,113,239,224,93,156,160,37,85,111,129,5,37,155,105,139,7,198,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
