(HTML editor not included, but some tools to start up your website with are..\n\nYou need a webserver. Three are included. The simplest is Server2Go, which can run from a\nCD or even a USB keychain drive. The CD mode is sloer than HDD, but hack-proof,\nportable, and good for a post-crash recovery.\nYou need a free URL redirection service which will cloak your origin IP addres (from your ISP\namong others) and let you use a port of your chocie, since your ISP likely blocks Port 80.\nThe homepage for DynSite (see next item) lists many. Recommended : 2mydns.com .\nThe Dynsite software updates your records with the redirection service with your current\nIP address, which with some/most ISPs will change with each reboot. Dynsite runs at\nbootup time, so that HTTP requests for the front-end URL the redirections service gives you\nwill immediately start going to the changed IP.
