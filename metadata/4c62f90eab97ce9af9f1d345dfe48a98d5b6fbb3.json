All of which I scanned at 700 DPI, so they are quite good quality.\n\nNothing was removed from the DVDs. The two live action are still in Anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) and the Animated is just widescreen (1.85:1)\n\nAll three are in their unrated directors cut editions.\n\nI believe that covers it. any questions just post.\n\nAudio: English DD 5.1\n\nSubs: English SDH, Spanish, French\n--007Ace--\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c62f90eab97ce9af9f1d345dfe48a98d5b6fbb3","amp;dn":"Chronicles+of+Riddick+-+Trillogy+%28Franchise+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c62f90eab97ce9af9f1d345dfe48a98d5b6fbb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,98,249,14,171,151,206,154,249,241,211,69,223,228,138,152,213,182,251,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
