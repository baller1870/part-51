Pai Piao, Danny Lee, and &quot;Venom&quot; Sun Chien star as idealistic police school graduates who run afoul of such vicious, murderous depravity that the cop who is killed first could be considered the lucky one. Many years later, film-lovers would celebrate the trend this movie represents as a manifestation of Hong Kong&amp;#039;s fears of abandonment and isolation, but no psychology is needed to appreciate the unremitting suspense of this powerful production. \n \nCast: Jason Pai Piao  ||  Danny Lee Sau-Yin  ||  Sun Chien  ||  Lily Li Li-Li  ||  Lo Lieh  ||  Yeung Chi-Hing  ||  Chiang Nan  ||  Keung Hon  ||  Lee Fat-Yuen  ||  Chan Shen  ||  Lo Wai  ||  Yuen Yat-Choh  ||  Wong Ching-Ho  ||  Austin Wai Tin-Chi  ||  Chow Kin-Ping  ||  Wong Siu-Ming  ||  Hung San-Nam  ||  Yiu Man-Gei  ||  Lam Sau-Kwan  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.541499/qx/details.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.541499/qx/details.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n_________________\nDo not break the share chain!
