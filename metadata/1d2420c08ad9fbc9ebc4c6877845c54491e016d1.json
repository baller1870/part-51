And because I don&amp;#039;t like very long songs and just a short climax, I tried to keep some speed in the mix.\n\nI hope you&amp;#039;ll enjoy it, please leave a comment with your opinion!\n\nTrackz:\n1. Digiwave\n2. Forever az One\n3. Scar Ur Face\n4. Speakafreak\n5. End of My Existence\n6. Rock Civilization\n7. Scantraxx rootz\n\nP.s. Of course all kudo&amp;#039;s go to mister Headhunter himself, but if you happen to have some left, please remember me ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d2420c08ad9fbc9ebc4c6877845c54491e016d1","amp;dn":"Tribute+to+the+Headhunterz+by+whis.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d2420c08ad9fbc9ebc4c6877845c54491e016d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,36,32,192,138,217,251,201,235,196,198,135,120,69,197,68,145,224,22,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
