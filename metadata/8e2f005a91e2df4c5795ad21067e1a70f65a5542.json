When the letters suddenly stop coming, Billy heads to Poland to figure out why -- only to discover that the orphanage that Irena was staying in, which is financed by honest -- and unsuspecting -- good-intentioned Samaritans, is a cover for a human trafficking network. Run by a man named Faisal, the operation is worth billions -- girls are sold and traded to the highest bidders from all over the world. Through Billy&amp;#039;s letters to Irina, Billy has taught Irina how to use secret codes, which she uses to keep Billy updated on where Faisal is taking her to. That&amp;#039;s how Billy stays on Faisal&amp;#039;s trail as Billy teams up with local cop Kasia Lato to rescue Irina and the other girls, and bring down Faisal&amp;#039;s human trafficking network.\n\nRegion: PAL\n   \nLanguage: Dolby Digital 5.1: Spanish, English.\n\n\nSubtitles: Spanish.\n\n\nDVD5=&gt;DVD5\n\nAnyDVD\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377100/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377100/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e2f005a91e2df4c5795ad21067e1a70f65a5542","amp;dn":"%5BCiclo+Steven+Seagal%5D+Out+of+Reach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e2f005a91e2df4c5795ad21067e1a70f65a5542","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,47,0,90,145,226,223,76,87,149,173,33,6,126,26,112,246,90,85,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
