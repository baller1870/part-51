Corey Galea, the voice and sound behind Power Modell whoÃƒÂ¢??s past times include hookers, booze and blackjack, started writing music back in 1998, and continues to write under the name Power Modell. With a arsenal of unique sounds, song structures and harsh blend of English &amp; Russian vocals, Power Modell is one of the rare few unique sounds moving about in the world of music these days. Primarily Power Modell is electronic, but continues to move through the styles that have influenced it. The next record, claiming to be an eccentric mix of 50ÃƒÂ¢??s rock and roll, punk and the insanity of industrial-pop that has established the Power Modell sound.
