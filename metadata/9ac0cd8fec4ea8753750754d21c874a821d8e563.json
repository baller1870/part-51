This took the premise of putting the very innocent and naive Gomer Pyle from the Andy Griffith show and putting him into the greatest killing machine ever. The thing that made this show great was not only his interaction with Sergeant Carter, but with other people as well. The situations that Gomer would get into as a result of his naive nature helped to make this show the classic that it was. Also, Frank Sutton created one of the classic characters in the history of television in Sergeant Carter. Not only could Carter be easily exasperated, but in a lot of instances he also could be seen as more of a big brother to Gomer as he bumbled his way through his hitch in the marines.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ac0cd8fec4ea8753750754d21c874a821d8e563","amp;dn":"Gomer+Pyle+U.S.M.C.+-+Season+1+-+Disc+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ac0cd8fec4ea8753750754d21c874a821d8e563","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,192,205,143,236,78,168,117,55,80,117,77,33,200,116,168,33,216,229,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
