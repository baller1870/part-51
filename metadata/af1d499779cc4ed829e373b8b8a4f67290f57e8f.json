Doctor&amp;#039;s Orders\n--------------------\n\n\n\n--------------------\n\\Info\\\n--------------------\nTheir is a little dissapointment to this score soundtrack. The theme played when Susan and Samuel L. jackson are flying to the research lab, and they fly over it, does not have a primary track on the soundtrack. This song is also played when they raise the shark into the lab for testing. All though their is no primary track for it, it is mainly played it 2 song, basicly Susan Softens would be the whole main thing, just not long. It is also played at the end of Anarchy.\n--------------------\n\nThis soundtrack is vary strong and powerful, and all though only 30 minutes long, it is vary fun to listen to with heavy bassed speakers and headphones. This is a worthy download!\nI will be modifying the main theme from Susan Softens to go twice as long.\nIf you wish to have the modified theme, email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;1d786d747e307b7168655d757269707c7471337e7270&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nHappy Downloading,\n   - EpicFlux","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af1d499779cc4ed829e373b8b8a4f67290f57e8f","amp;dn":"Deep+Blue+Sea+1999+%28Score+Soundtrack%29+Music+by+Trevor+Rabin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af1d499779cc4ed829e373b8b8a4f67290f57e8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,29,73,151,121,204,78,216,41,227,115,184,184,164,246,114,144,245,126,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
