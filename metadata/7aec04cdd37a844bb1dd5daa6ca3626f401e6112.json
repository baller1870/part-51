These exotic Chinese weapons became doubly deadly in the hands of some of the world?s most skilled assassins. Many Kung Fu weapons are incredibly brutal, like metal-link whips or sickle-shaped spears. Others are ingeniously lethal: miniature swords disguised as tobacco pipes, fans edged with razor-sharp blades, and poison-tipped arrows hidden in the wearer?s sleeve. Even common chopsticks can become savage weapons in the hands of a Kung Fu master. And while swinging rope darts could pulverize an opponent?s skull, the most terrifying weapon of all?the legendary flying guillotine?could decapitate an enemy entirely. This countdown reveals the ten deadliest Kung Fu weapons of all time, uncovering the dark secrets of their creation and leading up to the unbelievable story of the ultimate Chinese killing machine.\n\n\n\n\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: dfn-ngctoptenkungfuw.avi\nFilesize.....: 349 MB (or 357,870 KB or 366,458,880 bytes)\nRuntime......: 00:46:43 (70,077 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 912 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID&amp;#039;d as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 125 kb/s (62/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.90.\u0002Ã‚Â°\nFrame Size...: 448x336 (1.33:1) [=4:3]\nLanguage.....: English\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7aec04cdd37a844bb1dd5daa6ca3626f401e6112","amp;dn":"National+Geographic+-+Top+Ten+Kungfu+Weapons+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7aec04cdd37a844bb1dd5daa6ca3626f401e6112","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,236,4,205,211,122,132,75,177,221,93,170,108,163,98,111,64,30,97,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
