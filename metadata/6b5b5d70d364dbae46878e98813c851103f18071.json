Why the question of the purity of our origins is so important for science? It can affect the destiny of our species? Directing to a reflective glance our place in the standard order, the most outstanding evolucionistas risk in this documentary one to venture the future of the human being.\n\nThe 6 first documentary ones are of the BBC and respond to numerous questions on our evolution: Who were our ancestors? When they walked for the first time on the Earth? What other homÃƒÂ¸nidos coexisted with them? Why survived our ancestors whereas other homÃƒÂ¸nidos were extinguished?\nReconstructing the crucial moments of our evolution, &amp;#039;APE MAN&amp;#039; our trip of 5 million years vividly answers these questions when recreating from the origins of our species to the appearance of the man. This extraordinary history has been reconstructed by the scientists from numerous findings of fossils, prehistoric paintings, stone tools and rest of old genetic material. Step by step, the surprising drama of our history is kept awake. We will be witnesses of the old pain and fear of the man before the brutality of the life, and its love and joy before its beauty.\nThe 4 documentary rest are of History Channel and present/display the incredible history of the human evolution through the last progresses, interviews with scientists and anthropologists, and amazing simulations by computer. The series is presented/displayed by Walter Cronkite and rolled in Africa.\nDVD FULL\nPAL\nAUDIO:ING SPA 2.0\nSUB:SPA\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b5b5d70d364dbae46878e98813c851103f18071","amp;dn":"APE+MAN+Adventures+In+Human+Evolution+10+Science+and+fiction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b5b5d70d364dbae46878e98813c851103f18071","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,91,93,112,211,100,219,174,70,135,142,152,129,60,133,17,3,241,128,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
