After leaving the army, his friends take him to a carnival, where he meets the perfect girl, Annie, a sharp-shooting sideshow performer who loves guns as much as he. The two run off and marry, but Annie isn&amp;#039;t happy with their financial situation, so at her behest the couple begins a crosscountry string of daring robberies. Never one to use guns for killing, Bart is dragged down into oblivion by the greedy and violent nature of the woman he loves.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042530/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042530/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d703545241cb66c4e2495a9383bb8bc82afa23c","amp;dn":"Gun+Crazy.+Noir+from1950+Sub%3A+Eng%2C+Fra%2C+Esp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d703545241cb66c4e2495a9383bb8bc82afa23c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,112,53,69,36,28,182,108,78,36,149,169,56,59,184,188,130,175,162,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
