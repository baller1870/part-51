This is the documentary King of Kong, optimized for Nokia 6300 with a v05.00 firmware. May work on other phones and iPods/PSP&amp;#039;s, I don&amp;#039;t know. Anyway, scenes chopped at about 5 min. each, so you don&amp;#039;t have to fast-forward to continue if you don&amp;#039;t want to watch it all the same day.\n\nPlease have patience downloading, I might be offline from time to time. Stay leeching, and you will get it all. Please stay seeding after download.
