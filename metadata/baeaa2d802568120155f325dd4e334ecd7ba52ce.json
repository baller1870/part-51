Four farm men hit the road on a journey to the big smoky city and fight the powers that be. A wicked tale about an insane country going through some heavy changes. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baeaa2d802568120155f325dd4e334ecd7ba52ce","amp;dn":"Okraina+%28The+Outskirts%2FBack+Of+The+Beyond%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baeaa2d802568120155f325dd4e334ecd7ba52ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,234,162,216,2,86,129,32,21,95,50,93,212,227,52,236,215,186,82,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
