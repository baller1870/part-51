Digitally ripped from a 720p source.\n\nFilename: psu.vs.michigan.2006.aac.mp4\nFormat: h.264 608x336 AAC 2ch 48kHz 23 fps 608x336 pixels\nSize: 1.55 GB\nData Rate: 1.43mbits/sec\nDuration: 2:27:09\n\nThumbnail: http://www.personal.psu.edu/amw285/tor/thumbs.psu.vs.mich.2006.jpg\n\nFuture rips will be lower in quality, unfortunately. I got DirecTV, no more HD-DVR with firewire output. The best I can do next is s-video quality until further exploits are found on my HR20-700. I will concentrate on PSU games for fans out here. Possibly some NFL games also. I have lots of friends overseas who are dying to see some American Football action! Stay tune for my releases!\n\nWE ARE ... PENN STATE!\n\ncheers,\nBeepboy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8043a604299ac021d891374114306daecdbd9c53","amp;dn":"PSU+vs+Michigan+on+10%2F14%2F2006+at+Beaver+Stadium+608x336+h264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8043a604299ac021d891374114306daecdbd9c53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,67,166,4,41,154,192,33,216,145,55,65,20,48,109,174,205,189,156,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
