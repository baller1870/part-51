Notes are struck and left to \nfade into the distance. A slow beautiful flutey melody drifts through \nthe ether. A sequence starts up. Another melodic sequence bubbles \nto the surface taking us back to those heady days when our heroes \nstill had something exciting to say. This second sequence gains in \npower all the time whilst a stonking lead line hits all those musical \npleasure receptors (ooh err missus!). We even get some recited \nforeign text as in &amp;#039;Kiew Mission&amp;#039; (I think!). It all works so well. A \nwonderful way to start the album. The title track, at almost half an \nhour, is a real epic. Tranquil pads waft from the speakers then a \ncasual Eastern sounding lead line can just be heard. Enter a tabla type \nrhythmic sequence and it&amp;#039;s instant &amp;#039;Hyperborea&amp;#039;! \nAnother sequence falls into formation. The backing swells and things \nbecome increasingly syncopated. This is rapidly turning into another \ncracker, but they are not finished yet as another sequence bursts \nforth and the excitement level goes up yet another couple of notches. \nThere is a definite moodiness to the lead lines; a sort of edgy \nmelancholy which when contrasted with all the powerful pulsations \nmakes things even more effective. We get an explosion through \nwhich the pulsations surge, like fighter aircraft through a ball of flame. \nSome more sampled speech gives a sinister twist. A bass beat strikes \nup and in its wake the sequences morph to give a more optimistic \nfeel, enhanced by some lovely soft pads. In the seventeenth minute \nthe sequences start to subside, we get some manic laughing then \ndistorted echoing utterances. The mood changes once again as a \ntinkling sequence emerges from watery effects like air bubbles rising \nfrom a diver far below. There is a delicate beauty to it all. Backing \ndrones create a contrasting melancholia. A more percussive sequence \nenhances an already excellent passage of music still further. A slow \nthoughtful lead glides above the pulsations taking us to the end of \nanother excellent track with many a twist and turn along the way. \n\n&amp;#039;History&amp;#039; explodes onto the scene with vast reverberating fizzing stabs \nof sound. Sampled text calls out to a crowd on more than one \noccasion, relieving important events from the past. The tension builds \nand builds embellished by Jarre type electronic whooshes. The pace \nquickens as an insistent rhythm drives things forward along with a \nlovely thick bass line. A little melodic motif skips over the top. This is \nexcellent body moving stuff. A sharper lead line cuts through the air. \nEthereal pads and a more delicate sequence bring some contrast \nnearer the end but overall this is a non-compromising track full of \npower and attitude. With a track called &amp;#039;Sequenced&amp;#039; there are certain \nexpectations but it isn&amp;#039;t until the third minute that the expected rapid \nnote runs burst through. They are well worth waiting for however as \nmy hands are soon beating out time on the table, being taken along \nby the mounting excitement. Things become increasingly syncopated \nuntil just before the half way mark where the energy level subsides a \nlittle only to make things seem even more ball breaking when the vast \nwall of notes reappear.\n\n&amp;#039;Dive&amp;#039; appropriately starts with a drone that seems to go deeper and \ndeeper until it is replaced by ominous dark pads. You can almost feel \nthe vast weight of water above you. A tinkling loop shines through the \nblackness like a laser, bass pulses getting the heart to race. Thick \nmournful pads make a fleeting appearance then wallop, sequences \nand rhythms start to surge forward faster than I could take them in. \nAn almost anthemic lead completes the picture. Wordless female \nvocal colouring momentarily adds a little softness before we surge \nforwards once more. What an awesome way to finish what is I reckon \nthe best Pyramid Peak album yet.
