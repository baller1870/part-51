Purpose: How to Define It and Make It Work for You and Your Company\n\nJust read the first page of this manifesto, and youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll understand exactly what it is to have purpose. Read the subsequent pages and youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll find just how to develop your own sense of purpose through discovery, excellence, altruism and heroism.\n\n2. Beyond Snobbery: Grammar Need Not Be Cruel to Be Cool\n\nHere, June Casagrande (so not your ninth grade English teacher) will reassure you that itÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s okay not to care about grammar. Just what you wanted to hear! But with humor and enthusiasm, she will show you how grammar can be fun and worth a little bit of your time. So, uncover your eyes and learn her lesson. This wonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t hurt a bit\n\n3. Slow Leadership: Creating Civilized Organizations\n\nAdrian Savage proposes a return to civilization and humanity in organizations. Does this sound something like your day at the office? You are driving on a rain-soaked freeway. The other cars are speeding past you. You speed up to stay in the flow, but your knuckles are white as you grip the wheel. Familiar? Here\\&amp;#039;s how to find the next exit.\n\n4. Changing the Rules: Lessons from a Starfish World\n\nSuch seemingly dissimilar groups as the Apache Indians, music swapping programs, Wikipedia, Alcoholics Anonymous and Al Queda have one thing in common: they are all starfish. According to Brafman and Beckstrom, each of these resilient groups succeeds because they are absent any hierarchy (head) and conventional organizations (spiders) best watch their backs.\n\n5. 10 Unwealthy Habits\n\nA serial entrepreneur and wealth consultant, Alicia Castillo Holley, breaks down the negative habits that prevent us from gaining wealth. Written to address many individual viewpoints, she offers insight into how we can break those habits by first identifying them and then defying them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b781b6731b0b2fe59dbaa07cc752164d47d7d703","amp;dn":"Short.eBooks.Manifestos.%26.Tips.September.17.07-LegalTorrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b781b6731b0b2fe59dbaa07cc752164d47d7d703","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,129,182,115,27,11,47,229,157,186,160,124,199,82,22,77,71,215,215,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
