The commentary track is sometimes really interesting ad other times more boring\nand they have inserted commentaries from other persons assiciated with the film (or their relatives) from time to time. The documentary\nis a quick NTSC to PAL transfer, and some frames have ghosting (mostly visible in the movie clips), and partly repeats the things in the\ncommentary track, but is still interesting. The original DVD also had some trailers, but I personally find trailers boring, so this\nrelease is the essense of the movie. If you want the 5.1 Audio Track (where all the channel separation has been done nowadays) an the\ntrailers and the menus and subtitles, then buy the movie, for DVDs are generally selling for crazy low prices nowadays.\n\nThe movie isn&amp;#039;t divided this time, but you can do that manually with MKVToolnix or a ZIP/RAR-program or various other programs.\n\nMy view is that piracy is a suplement to owning DVDs, so buy some DVDs. Preferable ones with good bonus content and with good restoration\n(in case of older movies), so that the studios will continue to dump quality DVSs to good prices.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc708b67121c050ac86e1af91fa78604f1bc367c","amp;dn":"Vertigo+%28DVDRip+%2B+Extra%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc708b67121c050ac86e1af91fa78604f1bc367c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,112,139,103,18,28,5,10,200,110,26,249,31,167,134,4,241,188,54,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
