With this proven program, smokers will be throwing away their packs for good.\n\n\nThis is the audio program that I used to quit smoking. Carr does not belittle you, smash you over the head with information you already know, or tell you to cut back while doing the program. Instead he uses the most powerful weapon of all: your own mind. With it he reminds us of the greatness of being a non-smoker. I hope that you find it as useful as I did and please *gently* recommend it to your smoking friends.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b6f6bcfe11198885d8b2bb26c2d4a50fde52b18","amp;dn":"Easy+Method","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b6f6bcfe11198885d8b2bb26c2d4a50fde52b18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,111,107,207,225,17,152,136,93,139,43,178,108,45,74,80,253,229,43,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
