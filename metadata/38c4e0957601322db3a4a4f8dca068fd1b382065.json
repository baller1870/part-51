Why does she keep human body parts in the cellar?It really doesn\\&amp;#039;t matter much.Very soon,everyone gets involved in something much more interesting:having sex in every which way possible and impossible.Curt McDowell\\&amp;#039;s \\&quot;Thundercrack!\\&quot; is easily one of the most bizarre porno films I have ever seen.It\\&amp;#039;s shot in a black and white and loaded with raunchy hard core homo/hetero sex.The script is supremely strange and the acting is fine.Marion Eaton is especially memorable as a creepy Mrs Gert Hammond.I can\\&amp;#039;t wait to see a fully uncut 152-minutes long version of this film.9 out of 10.\n\nA combination of horror, porn, art,poetry and kitch. One of the weirdest films ever.\nPlease don\\&amp;#039;t whine about the explicit sex content - this is not a film for the Porn section of this tracker. If your English skills are any good - good luck in decrypting the dialogue.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38c4e0957601322db3a4a4f8dca068fd1b382065","amp;dn":"Thundercrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38c4e0957601322db3a4a4f8dca068fd1b382065","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,196,224,149,118,1,50,45,179,164,164,248,220,160,104,253,27,56,32,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
