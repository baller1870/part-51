More information at http://meetthegimp.org\n\n\nEpisode 9: Saving a Chapel (?..from underexposure)\n\nNorman mailed me two images - this was the original shot made by a friend of him.\n\nchapel-before-500.jpg\n\n? and he made this out of it.\n\nchapel-after-500.jpg\n\nQuite impressive. I redid his work in the video and added some extras for the sky. You?ll see an other way to rotate an image, two ways to blend different versions of an image with a layer mask and a bit more about curves. I got this as a result.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5fee2e35c0253f1ff3a71473bbaafe0979e9514","amp;dn":"%5C%22Meet+the+Gimp%21%5C%22+Videopodcast+Episode+9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5fee2e35c0253f1ff3a71473bbaafe0979e9514","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,254,226,227,92,2,83,241,255,58,113,71,59,186,175,224,151,158,149,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
