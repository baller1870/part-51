It&amp;#039;s a bit more complicated than that, but that&amp;#039;s basically it. After he was arrested at gunpoint in our apartment at 7 am in the morning I realised that I, too, was the focus of surveillance. As were colleagues, friends and family. It was made quite clear that we were meant to notice.\n\nMy partner was released from prison after three weeks and by now the terrorism charges were taken back and turned into accusations of having formed a &amp;#039;criminal organisation&amp;#039;.\n\nAfter the initial shock I started blogging about everyday life with surveillance.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdcf8c799cfa75c429c55b34db5ce166177cab14","amp;dn":"24c3-2381-en-what_is_terrorism.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdcf8c799cfa75c429c55b34db5ce166177cab14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,207,140,121,156,250,117,196,41,197,91,52,219,92,225,102,23,124,171,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
