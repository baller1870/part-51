During the sales transaction, she grows increasingly puzzled by the comments and actions of both the male elevator operator who transported her to the barren, seemingly deserted floor, and the aloof female salesclerk behind the counter who sells her the thimble. As Marsha rides the elevator back down from the 9th floor, she notices that the thimble is scratched and dented, and is directed by the elevator operator to the Complaints Department on the third floor. But, when she tries to convince Mr. Armbruster, the sales supervisor, and Mr. Sloan, the store manager, that she bought the item on the 9th floor, she is told that the 9th floor doesn&amp;#039;t exist. Marsha then becomes distraught after she spots the salesclerk who sold her the thimble and is shocked to discover that the woman isn&amp;#039;t really a salesclerk at all -- she&amp;#039;s one of the department store&amp;#039;s display mannequins. While resting in an office following her frightening discovery, Marsha finds herself locked inside in the now-closed store. She attempts to find a way out, and becomes alarmed by mysterious voices calling to her and by some subtle movements made by the supposedly lifeless mannequins around her. Becoming hysterical, she flees to an elevator, which once again transports her to the unoccupied 9th floor. There, she learns from the others present -- mannequins who suddenly come to life and greet her -- that she, too, is a mannequin. Each one of them gets to go out into the world and live among the humans for one month. But Marsha had enjoyed her stay among &quot;the others&quot; so much that she had lost track of her return date and was away from the store for too long; she had forgotten her true nature. But now she realizes that she is back in her proper place, which allows the next mannequin in line -- the female salesclerk who sold her the thimble -- to go out and live among the humans for 30 days. As Marsha fondly recalls her brief sojourn out among the humans, she grows rigid and statue-like. The next day the store supervisor, Mr. Armbruster, is making his morning rounds on the salesfloor and does a sudden double-take upon seeing a faintly familiar-looking mannequin on display.\n\n\nMP4 Format for your IPOD\n\nPLEASE SEED! \n\nEnjoy! \n\nAntil0ck\n\n_______       ______________________      ______  \n___    |________  /___(_)__  /_  __ ________  /__\n__  /| |_  __   __/_  /__  /_  / / /  ___/_  //_/\n_  ___ |  / / / /_ _  / _  / / /_/ // /__ _  ,&lt;   \n/_/  |_/_/ /_/__/ /_/  /_/  ____/ ___/ /_/|_| ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48bcb728e51665d75a66c5728ff51b1ecd581169","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+Episode+34-+The+After+hours","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48bcb728e51665d75a66c5728ff51b1ecd581169","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,188,183,40,229,22,101,215,90,102,197,114,143,245,27,30,205,88,17,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
