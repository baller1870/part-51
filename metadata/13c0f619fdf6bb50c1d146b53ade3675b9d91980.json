In one six-day period, there were twenty-four abductions, leading many to hire bodyguards for their children. Into this world enters John Creasy, a burned-out ex-CIA operative/assassin, who has given up on life. Creasy&amp;#039;s friend Rayburn brings him to Mexico City to be a bodyguard to nine-year-old Pita Ramos, daughter of industrialist Samuel Ramos and his wife Lisa. Creasy is not interested in being a bodyguard, especially to a youngster, but for lack of something better to do, he accepts the assignment. Creasy barely tolerates the precocious child and her pestering questions about him and his life. But slowly, she chips away at his seemingly impenetrable exterior, his defenses drop, and he opens up to her. Creasy&amp;#039;s new-found purpose in life is shattered when Pita is kidnapped. Despite being seriously wounded during the kidnapping, he vows to kill anyone involved in or profiting from the kidnapping. And no one can stop him.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNTSC - WideScreen (16x9) - Region 4 Retail \nSize: 4,32 GB (*.iso) \nAudio: English DD 5.1 &amp; PortuguÃƒÂªs(BR) 5.1 \nSubtitles: English, EspaÃƒÂ±ol &amp; PortuguÃƒÂªs (BR) \nMenu: English \nExtras: Yes \nEncoding Info: \n- DVD-RB v1.22 \n- AVISYNTH 2.5.5.0 \n- CCE SP2 1.0.0.15 \n- Reduction Level for DVD-5: 60,9% \n- Overall Bitrate : 4.236/3.389Kbs \n- Space for Video : 3.639.816KB \n- HIGH/LOW/TYPICAL Bitrates: 3.822/354/3.389 Kbs \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13c0f619fdf6bb50c1d146b53ade3675b9d91980","amp;dn":"Man+On+Fire+%282004%29+%2ANTSC%2A+Audio%3A+Eng+%26+Port%28BR%29+%2B+3+Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13c0f619fdf6bb50c1d146b53ade3675b9d91980","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,192,246,25,253,246,187,80,193,209,70,181,58,222,54,117,185,217,25,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
