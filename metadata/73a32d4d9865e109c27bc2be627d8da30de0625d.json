Armani! Versace! at every turn, a world populated by stylish women and beautiful men. With breathtaking ease, Miranda can turn each and every one of these hip sophisticates into a scared, whimpering child.\n\nThe Devil Wears Prada gives a rich and hilarious new meaning to &quot;the boss from Hell.&quot; Narrated in Andrea&amp;#039;s smart, refreshingly disarming voice, it traces a deep, dark, devilish view of life at the top only hinted at in gossip columns. From sending the latest, not-yet-in-stores Harry Potter to Miranda&amp;#039;s children in Paris by private jet, to serving lattes to Miranda at precisely the piping hot temperature she prefers, Andrea is sorely tested each and every day - and often late into the night. She puts up with it all by keeping her eyes on the prize: a recommendation from Miranda that will get Andrea a top job at any magazine of her choosing. As things escalate from the merely unacceptable to the downright outrageous, however, Andrea begins to realize that the job a million girls would die for may just kill her. And even if she survives, she has to decide whether the job is worth the price of her soul.\n                                            \n                                         \n\n\n             ****************************************************\n\nIf you like audio books please buy some.
