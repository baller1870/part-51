He offers her a thousand dollars to pretend to be his girlfriend for a month. It succeeds, but he soon learns that the price of popularity may be higher than he expected.&quot;\n\n- English captions only.\n\n\nI must have seen this movie a million times as a kid. It&amp;#039;s one of those feel good comedies that only the eighties could produce, and although it&amp;#039;s not my release I still want to share it with you guys. I will be seeding in about thirty minutes from now.\nEnjoy. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e108e0661640365d5d60675c26187edebb48acb4","amp;dn":"Can%5C%27t+Buy+Me+Love","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e108e0661640365d5d60675c26187edebb48acb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,8,224,102,22,64,54,93,93,96,103,92,38,24,126,222,187,72,172,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
