This Version (3.0)\nwas created October 1, 2007. Originally,\nthe disk made use of MS-DOS 6.22 (1.0),\nand DR-DOS 7.03 (1.1), with the DR-DOS\nFAT-32 descriptor. Version 2.0 utilized\nFreeDOS, and this was carried over to\nthe current version (3.0). Note that\neven though DOS is used, this utility\nhas ZERO problems imaging NTFS volumes.\nIt handles FAT16, FAT32 and NTFS with\nease. I haven&amp;#039;t tested it with any other\nfile systems, such as Linux, but I think\nit should work. It was created to give\nme an easy method of imaging the drives\nof my Windows 98 and ME systems - After\nMicrosoft announced that support for\nthese Operating Systems would no longer\nbe available after a certain date, I\nneeded a way to image my drives with the\nlast available updates for those Operating\nSystems, and this utility filled the bill\nquite nicely. I have yet to find a system\nthat this utility doesn&amp;#039;t work with, as\nlong as you have a bootable floppy diskette\ndrive, then you are good to go.\n\nTo use this utility, place the floppy\ndiskette in your drive and re-boot or\nboot your system, making sure that it is\nset to boot from floppy. FreeDOS will\nload, create a RAMDisk, decompress the\nsupport files to the RAMDisk and execute\nthe utility, which will present a menu\nas follows:\nSELECT A TASK TO PERFORM?\n1] IMAGE PRIMARY HARD DRIVE\n2] IMAGE SECONDARY HARD DRIVE\n3] RESTORE PRIMARY HARD DRIVE\n4] RESTORE SECONDARY HARD DRIVE\n5] VERIFY IMAGE INTEGRITY\n6] EXIT THIS UTILITY\nPLEASE SELECT (1-6).\n\nOptions 1 and 2 will image your primary\nand secondary hard drives, respectively,\nincluding all partitions, to either CD,\nDVD or both. I have tested it with many\nbrands of CD and DVD burners, and it\nhas never failed to work.\n\nOptions 3 and 4 will restore your primary\nand secondary hard drives, respectively,\nfrom a previous backup. Note that a\nrestore can be made regardless of whether\nthe original drive has been replaced or\nnot - as long as the drive is at least as\nlarge as the image to be restored, it will\nwork.\n\nOption 5 will allow you to verify the\nimage file disc set - YOU SHOULD ALWAYS\nverify the integrity of the image, just\nto be sure it worked! I use Re-Writable\nmedia, but it has never failed to generate\na successful image (there&amp;#039;s always a\nfirst time though).\n\nOption 6 will exit the utility at which\npoint, you may remove the diskette and\nre-boot your machine.\n\nNOTE 1: Your primary and secondary hard\ndrives are determined by your BIOS.\n\nNOTE 2: The utility will use the first\nrecordable drive in your system. There are\nno provisions for changing this. In my\nsystem, this is a DVD Burner, which is\nmuch more useful for imaging than a CD\nBurner.\n\nThe first CD/DVD of a restore set is bootable, allowing a restore\nto be performed without needing the floppy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c246f922de553a803ec889b2ccb351e156031e33","amp;dn":"PfP+Restore+CD+Creator+3.0+%28Create+your+own+restore+CD%5C%27s+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c246f922de553a803ec889b2ccb351e156031e33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,70,249,34,222,85,58,128,62,200,137,178,204,179,81,225,86,3,30,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
