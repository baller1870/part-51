A literary script that is totally accessible. A melodrama for the thinking man. A film that is as engrossing and entertaining every time you see it. Bette Davis touches all the raw nerves of her mythological career. Anne Baxter never went this far. Thelma Ritter became a sort of icon. Marilyn Monroe gives us a preview of forthcoming attractions as a graduated from the \\&quot;Copacabana\\&quot; academy of dramatic arts. Celeste Holm represents us, all of us and George Sanders creates a prototype for a cultured monster that is immediately recognizable. I don\\&amp;#039;t recall another film in which the nature of selfishness is so wittily dissected. A total triumph. \n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebc04d60dde277c2b1b9ca38453e07a0a0264bd4","amp;dn":"all+about+eve","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebc04d60dde277c2b1b9ca38453e07a0a0264bd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,192,77,96,221,226,119,194,177,185,202,56,69,62,7,160,160,38,75,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
