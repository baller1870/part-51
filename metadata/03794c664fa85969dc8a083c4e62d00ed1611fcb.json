But his blue-collar family only laughs as his ambitions--they \nknow Rudy will follow his father and brothers to the local steel mill. And, for four long years after high school, he does just that.\nBut some dreams just won\\&amp;#039;t die, as Rudy proves when he goes to heroic, occasionally hilarious, lengths to win admission to Notre Dame. Once there, \nhe becomes a walk-on player, serving as little more than a human tackling \ndummy against the starting players.\nBloodied but unbeaten, Rudy wins the respect of legendary coach Ara Parseghian and the other Irish players, who give him one shot at gridiron glory.\nAn incredible, true story from the creators of HOOSIERS, Rudy is an \nunforgettable testament to the power of dreams and the triumph of the common \nman.\n\n\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES:\n* Digitally Mastered Audio &amp; Anamorphic Video\n* Widescreen Presentation\n* Audio: English 5.1 Dolby Digital; Spanish audio as well\n* Subtitles: English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Thai\n* Three Exclusive featurettes\n* Bonus Trailers\n* Talent Files (whatever)\n* Interactive Menus &amp; Scene Selections","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03794c664fa85969dc8a083c4e62d00ed1611fcb","amp;dn":"RUDY+-+1993+-+Sean+Astin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03794c664fa85969dc8a083c4e62d00ed1611fcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,121,76,102,79,168,89,105,220,138,8,60,78,98,208,14,209,97,31,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
