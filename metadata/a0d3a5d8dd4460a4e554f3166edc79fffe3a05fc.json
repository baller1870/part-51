Try to relax as you always do when you try to sleep. When you hear the sound (Qwerty - Method II - PR1 Sound), Remember to check that you are still aware, don&amp;#039;t move any part of your body, just check. When you have fallen asleep, you will hopefully remember to check that you are aware and that your body is asleep. This may trigger a great experience, don&amp;#039;t be afraid.\n\nCreated by Qwerty at Soul Travel forum (http://www.sasser.net/forum)\n\nRemember to seed as I will not be able to have my computer turned on 247.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0d3a5d8dd4460a4e554f3166edc79fffe3a05fc","amp;dn":"Qwerty+-+Method+II+-+PR1+%28Pre-Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0d3a5d8dd4460a4e554f3166edc79fffe3a05fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,211,165,216,221,68,96,164,229,84,243,22,110,220,121,255,254,58,5,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
