Sure, they arranged a concert back in 2003 but it was cancelled... Hmmm.. They should really check up on their facts, cause it was a tad embarrasing....but anyways.....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc5a427ab4598cb3b72400238c69a005f0edc05f","amp;dn":"Linkin+Park+-+Live+in+Copenhagen+Denmark+May+24+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc5a427ab4598cb3b72400238c69a005f0edc05f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,90,66,122,180,89,140,179,183,36,0,35,140,105,160,5,240,237,192,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
