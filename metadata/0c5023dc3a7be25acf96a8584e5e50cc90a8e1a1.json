In the east of Sweden there were a lot of good bands in the 80Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s. Like RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶vsvett, Raped Teenagers, No Idea, S.O.D etc. Wounded Knee did some gigs around Sweden and I think some in Finland. WK was around til the early 90Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s before they quit. Also did another EP and 1 LP, but I personally think this is the best shit they created. \nRagge is still playing music and HT Pop Gun plays in Alliansen.\n\nCompressed with Win rar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c5023dc3a7be25acf96a8584e5e50cc90a8e1a1","amp;dn":"Wounded+Knee-EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c5023dc3a7be25acf96a8584e5e50cc90a8e1a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,80,35,220,58,123,226,90,207,150,168,88,78,94,80,204,144,168,225,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
