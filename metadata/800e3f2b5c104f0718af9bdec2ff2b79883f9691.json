Miller of Well TV announced the release of a new documentary about the threat to medical freedom of choice. &amp;#039;We Become Silent: The Last Days of Health Freedom&amp;#039; details the ongoing attempts by multinational pharmaceutical interests and giant food companies ? in concert with the WTO, the WHO and others ? to limit the public?s access to herbs, vitamins and other therapies.\n\n&amp;#039;We Become Silent? is narrated by Dame Judi Dench, the noted UK actress who has won multiple Golden Globe awards, an Oscar, and a Tony for her on-stage work, in addition to dozens of other honors throughout her prestigious career.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=451097355502728465&amp;q=we+become+silent&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=451097355502728465&amp;q=we+become+silent&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWe Become Silent\n\nPharmaceutical giants and other globalized bureaucratic interests are threatening our very health freedoms. Our access to natural foods, vitamins, and herbs will be severely crippled, and eventually non existent.\nQUOTES FROM THIS DOCUMENTARY\n\n    ?Fear preys on the most vulnerable among us. Fear sells. And nowhere is fear peddled more shamelessly than in the fields of medicine and human nutrition. And of course the fear mongers are also praying on fear of disease. And the solution that the fear mongers give us are drugs. Yet drugs are the single most dangerous thing we can put in our mouths.?&quot;Fear anesthetizes us. It coerces us, making us believe we can do little on our own to prevent or treat disease. And forces whole nations to kneel at the alters of the drug industries. It?s a sad fact that pharmaceuticals have become the dope of modern man. And make no mistake, we are addicted. Last year between 3 and 5 billion prescriptions were written in the U.S. alone.?\n\n    ?But the fear machine is well oiled by petrochemical dollars, and a near worldwide monopoly in health care. It works overtime to prevent the truth about dietary supplements from getting out to the public. Governments, particularly in Europe and the United States seem all to eager to comply with the robber barons of health care.?\n\n    ?There are some who say this battle cannot be won. We are the David, they are the Goliath. But it?s too important to sit it out and allow the multinational corporations and the regulators to inform us what our freedoms should be. If we don?t demand medical freedom of choice we will lose it. It?s critical that the people of Europe, the people of Asia, Africa, the Americas and the rest of the world come together so we can protect our health freedom for our generation and those of the future.?\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracyrealitytv.com/we-become-silent/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracyrealitytv.com/we-become-silent/&lt;/a&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nTech specs:\n\nGeneral #0 \nFormat : Google Video \nFormat/Info : Hack of AVI \nFormat/Family : RIFF \nFile size : 172 MiB \nPlayTime : 28mn 37s \nBit rate : 833 Kbps \n\nVideo #0 \nCodec : DivX \nCodec/Family : MPEG-4 \nCodec/Info : Mainly used by Google \nCodec settings/PacketBitStream : No \nCodec settings/BVOP : No \nCodec settings/QPel : No \nCodec settings/GMC : 0 \nCodec settings/Matrix : Default \nPlayTime : 28mn 37s \nBit rate : 692 Kbps \nWidth : 400 pixels \nHeight : 288 pixels \nAspect ratio : 1.389 \nFrame rate : 29.970 fps \nResolution : 8 bits \nChroma : 4:2:0 \nInterlacement : Progressive \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.200 \nWriting library : Lavc51.7.0 \n\nAudio #0 \nCodec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3 \nCodec profile : Joint stereo \nBit rate : 128 Kbps \nBit rate mode : CBR \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nSampling rate : 44 KHz \nResolution : 16 bits \nCoherency/PlayTime : 4107 \n\n===============================================================================\nLearn the true nature of the world, come visit our huge dedicated e-library and forums @ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969/index.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.info/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.info/index.php&lt;/a&gt;\n===============================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:800e3f2b5c104f0718af9bdec2ff2b79883f9691","amp;dn":"We+Become+Silent+-+The+Last+Days+of+Health+Freedom+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"800e3f2b5c104f0718af9bdec2ff2b79883f9691","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,14,63,43,92,16,79,7,24,175,155,222,194,255,43,121,136,63,150,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
