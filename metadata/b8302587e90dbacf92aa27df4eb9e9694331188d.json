In that year they also recorded their first demo, ?A Walesi BÃƒÂ¡rdok?, in English ?The Bards Of Wales?, realising the famous ballad of Hungarian poet JÃƒÂ¡nos Arany. 2005 then had the full debut in store, ?Fergeteg?, ?Storm?, and the six Hungarians really unleash a storm here and there.\n\nFolk Metal it is that the guys and girl have chosen as their poison, here and there with a sprinkle of Gothic Metal, but the use of flute and violin show, where the roots lie, in Hungarian folklore. And after a quiet keyboard intro they furiously set out with ?VÃƒÂ©dj Meg LÃƒÂ¡ng?, with a lot of variety from quiet to hammering double-bass, with cool flute and changing vocals, Laura Binder definitely does not have a soprano, while Andras Ficzek?s a bit rough and unpolished voice might not be to everybody?s liking, yet it has character, while the Hungarian vocals help to convey tons of energy and are truly entertaining!\n\n(...)\n\nHere and there there?s still some bumps and not all arrangements are completely matured, still ?Fergeteg? is a damn good and variable debut that I recommend to all fans of this style and I dare to prophesy that we will hear a lot of ECHO OF DALRIADA in the future!
