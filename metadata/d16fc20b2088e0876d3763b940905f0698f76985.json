Unlike other software with complex settings, 1CLICK DVD COPY? 5 can be used by anyone to make perfect copies of DVD movies.\n\nCPRx is a unique and innovative solution to copy new DVD movies which contain bad sectors or bad DVD structure. Many popular DVD movies are now created in such a way as to make it difficult for backup software to copy them properly.

Just as we&amp;#039;ve become accustomed to relying on anti-virus software to keep us protected against the latest viruses, we must also rely on new updates of CPRx to ensure we can copy the latest DVD releases. With 1CLICK&amp;#039;s update notification feature, you can rest assured that you will be notified every time a new version of the software is available.\n\nKey Features:\n- CPRx? technology for copying new DVD movies.\n- Integrated burn engine.\n- Make a high quality copy of just the movie or include the extras.\n- Copies Episodic DVD Movies; TV Series, etc.\n- Copy a DVD movie on one disc - no need to split.\n- Copy a movie to your hard drive - great for laptops.\n- Supports Dual Layer media.\n- Supports both NTSC and PAL DVD movies.\n- Free software updates and technical support for a year.\n\nCompatible with Windows Vista, XP, 2000, Me or 98SE.\n\nChanges in 1CLICK DVD Copy 5.2.2.1 (May 29, 2007):\n- Fix for movies like &quot;Apocalypto&quot;, in which the main audio language is &quot;unspecified&quot; and is not automatically selected (ie. default language is English will result in only English audio being selected).
