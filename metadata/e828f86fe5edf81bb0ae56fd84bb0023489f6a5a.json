It goes without saying then that the performance will be exceptional; Volkswagen reckons this beast will do 0-62mph in a blurry 3.7 seconds, while the top speed is a supercar-defining 202mph. Providing this power is a 6.0-litre 12-cylinder engine as used in the Phaeton luxury cruiser, which has been tuned to give an extra 200bhp. Like any true exotic, the W12 engine is also mid-mounted to improve road holding, and the drive is channelled to the rear wheels via a six-speed automatic gearbox.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e828f86fe5edf81bb0ae56fd84bb0023489f6a5a","amp;dn":"VW+Gti+W12","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e828f86fe5edf81bb0ae56fd84bb0023489f6a5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,40,248,111,229,237,248,27,176,174,86,253,132,187,0,35,72,159,106,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
