While I enjoyed &quot;House of 1,000 Corpses&quot; I think this follow-up sequel was far better. &quot;House of 1,000 Corpses&quot; was more like a carnival freak show with supernatural and unbelievable scenarios, whereas &quot;The Devil&amp;#039;s Rejects&quot; was quite realistic and very brutal. \n\n\n\nThis film is in the vein of &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, and &amp;#039;Otis&amp;#039; pays homage to Charles Manson, even hauntingly resembling him. &quot;The Devil&amp;#039;s Rejects&quot; is full of bloody carnage, perversion, filthiness, vulgarity, and the characters are sadistic and relentless serial killers. It is not for the feint of heart or the squeamish. There are some clever and quite humorous lines in the movie, along with some very disturbing ones as well. Sherri Moon Zombie gives a stellar performance as &amp;#039;Baby&amp;#039; that is quite unforgettable. It was great to see P.J. Soles (Halloween) in this film, still looking beautiful as ever. Leslie Easterland, &amp;#039;Mama Firefly&amp;#039;, really gives an excellent performance as the perverted and disgusting mother of the clan. All of the actors did an amazing job in this movie and were very convincing as their characters.\n\n\n\nThe cinematography of this film was really brilliant, and uses the &amp;#039;swipe&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;freeze-frame&amp;#039; methods, sometimes resembling a comic book adventure. The music was classic seventies rock, and fits well with the road trip theme. The gore was spectacular and realistic, and sometimes even disgusted me at times, which is hard to accomplish. I gave this movie a &quot;10 out of 10&quot; because it is full of spectacular, clever, and gruesome horror-movie fun! It contains scenes which seriously make the viewer cringe and feel sympathy for the victims, while hating the serial killers. I&amp;#039;ve never felt so much hatred and disgust towards the villains as I did during this film, and that goes to show you how convincing this movie really is! If you like Rob Zombie, seventies slashers, and a good horror movie plot, with edge of your seat/nail-biting scenes, then this is the movie for you! Check it out, its jaw-droppingly great\n\n\nFFF gives this movie 3 horsecocks rating; very entertaining","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8e9025feec42412ce5f0f6e7a751df8a1d7635b","amp;dn":"The+devil%5C%27s+rejects......FFF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8e9025feec42412ce5f0f6e7a751df8a1d7635b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,233,2,95,238,196,36,18,206,95,15,110,122,117,29,248,161,215,99,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
