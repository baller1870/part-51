Just type in an address, press Search, and you?ll zoom right in.\n- Search for schools, parks, restaurants, and hotels. Get driving directions.\n- Tilt and rotate the view to see 3D terrain and buildings, or look up to explore the sky\n- Save and share your searches and favorites.\n\nGoogle Earth Pro For professional and commercial uses.\nGoogle Earth Pro is the ultimate research, presentation, and collaboration tool for location-specific information.\n\nWith Google Earth Pro, it?s easy to research locations and present your discoveries. In just a few clicks, you can import site plans, property lists or client sites and share the view with your client or colleague. You can even export high-quality images to documents or the web.\n\n\n\nAnnotate and visualize\nRepresent your location-based data using 3D drawing tools, or transfer up to 2,500 locations by address or geospatial coordinates from a spreadsheet. The GIS Data Importing Module lets you incorporate GIS data in file formats such as .shp and .tab. Examples include parcel, demographic, and 3D building data.\n\nShare and analyze\nShare your Google Earth views and data representations with your clients as a KML, Google Earth?s original file format. With your upgraded Pro subscription, you get additional measurement tools (square feet, mile, acreage, radius and so on), so simply select the points on the screen using your mouse and let Google Earth calculate the rest.\n\nCreate visually powerful presentations\nExport high-resolution images up to 11&quot; x 17&quot; (4800 pixels, sample print - 890k), and use them in documents, presentations, web or printed materials. You audience can come along for the ride as you create your own compressed movies (.wmv, sample movie - 13MB) of the zooms and virtual tours you take in Google Earth.\n\nUseful for many industries\nWhether you?re in commercial real estate, insurance or media, Google Earth Pro lets you represent geo-specific information to full dramatic effect. Learn how it?s applicable to your industry.\n    \nExplore the Sky\nSwitch your view to see the sky above your Earth location, and explore far-away galaxies, nebulae, and more. Zoom in to see imagery from the Hubble Space Telescope, learn about the lifecycle of a star, or even view the constellations. After all, the Earth doesn&amp;#039;t sit in a vacuum... that would be an awful waste of space.\n\nHigh-resolution photos, and more\nWhen 3D terrain and buildings aren&amp;#039;t enough, check out the new high-resolution photos. They line up with the terrain, so you can see the real deal superimposed on our 3D imagery. You can find the high-resolution photos in the Layers menu, along with new content such as traffic.\n\nCreate and Share Geographic Information\nMillions of Google Earth users add and share geographic information every day using .KML, the Google Earth file format. In Google Earth 4 we?ve expanded that capability. Now you can view travel photos, hiking trails uploaded from your GPS, overlays of your own imagery, or large geographic data sets. You can even time-stamp the data to create animations of how the world changes over time. Explore Google Earth Showcase for some popular examples.\n\nExplore rich 3D content\nSeeing 3D terrain and buildings is one of the coolest features of Google Earth. We?ve added higher-quality terrain data for many mountainous regions, as well as support for &quot;textured&quot; 3D buildings - meaning bricks look like real bricks, glass looks like real glass, and overall, the world looks more like the real world. It&amp;#039;s just one more step on the path of creating a life-like 3D model of the whole planet.\n\n\n`=====================================================`\n.: P2PCRACKERS NOTICE :.\n`=====================================================`\n\n\nWhats up dudes ?\nPlease dont retag our releases you cunt, and leave nfo! no strip... :)\nNow Go leak this motherfucker!\n\nCopyrights @ P2PCRACKERS - HAHA LOL!\n\n\n`=====================================================`\n.: END OF RELEASE NFO :.\n`=====================================================`\n      ____________________\n     |  | P2PCRACKERS  |  |\n     |[]|              |[]|\n     |  | SECRET TOOLS |  |\n     |  |              |  |\n     |  |              |  |\n     |  |______________|  |\n     |                    |\n     |     ____________   |\n     |    | __      |  |  |\n     |    ||  |     |  |  |\n     |    ||__|     |  |  |\n     |____|_________|__|__|\n`=====================================================`","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:024138aaf155d128e4734b657660e6dfd0cebadf","amp;dn":"Google.Earth.v4.2.Incl.Patch-P2PCRACKERS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"024138aaf155d128e4734b657660e6dfd0cebadf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,65,56,170,241,85,209,40,228,115,75,101,118,96,230,223,208,206,186,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
