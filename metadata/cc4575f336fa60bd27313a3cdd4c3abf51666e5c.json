Literally!\n\nShaun&amp;#039;s nearing 30, stuck in a crappy sales job, and his girlfriend Liz is unhappy with the amount of time he spends with his ultra-slacker B-class drug dealer friend, Ed, at their local pub, the Winchester. When Liz dumps him, Shaun&amp;#039;s so glum he doesn&amp;#039;t even realise that London&amp;#039;s been overrun with flesh-eating zombies. But somewhere within his console-happy lazy self, a hero is born.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc4575f336fa60bd27313a3cdd4c3abf51666e5c","amp;dn":"Shaun+Of+The+Dead+%282004%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc4575f336fa60bd27313a3cdd4c3abf51666e5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,69,117,243,54,250,96,189,39,49,58,60,221,76,58,191,81,102,110,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
