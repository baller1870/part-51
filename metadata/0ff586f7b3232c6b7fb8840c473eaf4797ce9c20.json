Windows Vista Home Premium x86 32-bit Dell OEM.iso file.\n\nUse Nero Burning ROM, PowerISO, MagicISO, ISO Recorder, or your favorite app to burn the ISO to a blank DVD. It is a bootable ISO, so pop it in your DVD drive, reboot, and you\\&amp;#039;re good to go!\n\n2.) Clony OneClick Activator\n\nAll you need to do is double-click this file, and it will install. When told to do so, reboot, and Vista will be activated. Kudos to Clonysoft for this, as I did not make it. So far, this is the only one that worked 100% of the time for me, and my colleagues.\n\nAnd you\\&amp;#039;ll be done! Passes WGA and updates as it would usually. \n\nI will seed as long as I can.
