Half human, half monster, these silver-eyed slayers possess supernatural strength, but are condemned to fight their savage impulses or lose their humanity completely.\n\nMosh Says\n=========\nGreat manga! Awesome action manga, but don&amp;#039;t compare it to other action mangas, great storyline that keeps you wishing for some more volumes [haven&amp;#039;t found them yet, hold ya horses :P].\nActually, i can say its one of the best Mangas i&amp;#039;ve seen. The anime makes the manga seem like God btw. Tho follows the storyline pretty good too [the anime is NOT posted].\n\nHope you like it.
