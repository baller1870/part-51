Geils (guitar); Peter Wolf (vocals); Magic Dick (harmonica). All tracks have been digitally remastered. Although it didn&amp;#039;t sell in the same numbers as their &amp;#039;80s releases LOVE STINKS and FREEZE FRAME, the J. Geils Band&amp;#039;s 1977 album MONKEY ISLAND is considered to be one of the group&amp;#039;s best recordings amongst longtime fans. While a few of the tracks still retain the festive rock direction of their earlier releases (most notably their upbeat cover of &quot;I Do,&quot; which would become an instant concert staple), MONKEY ISLAND contains a dark undercurrent throughout. This is most notable on the epic title track, which sounds at times like a jam session between the Rolling Stones and Santana, as well as the vicious rocker &quot;Somebody.&quot; MONKEY ISLAND remains the J. Geils Band&amp;#039;s most underrated and often overlooked album. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c94cabb2274678172e38f998398f3bdb90ca508d","amp;dn":"J+Geils+Band+-+Monkey+Island++flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c94cabb2274678172e38f998398f3bdb90ca508d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,76,171,178,39,70,120,23,46,56,249,152,57,143,59,219,144,202,80,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
