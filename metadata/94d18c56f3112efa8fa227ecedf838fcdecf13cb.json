MP2TSME accepts the widest variety of input streams, including H.264 / AVC / MPEG-4 video. It also supports creation and multiplexing of DVB, ATSC, and user-defined tables. \n\nIts proven multiplexing core technology and powerful tool kit has made it the number one choice for a wide range of professional applications such as video-on-demand, digital video broadcasting, post-production and MPEG equipment manufacturing.\n\nThis is a FULLY FUNCTIONAL version of the program. To get around the trial\n\ntime limit you must set your computer&amp;#039;s date a few years into the future. If it\n\ndoesn&amp;#039;t work keep setting it a few years ahead until it does. You must do this\n\neverytime you start the program. Slightly inconvenient but it works.\n\n\n\nIf some intrepid person wants to create a simple crack for this and share it with\n\nthe rest of us please do so!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94d18c56f3112efa8fa227ecedf838fcdecf13cb","amp;dn":"Manzanita+MP2TSME+4.0.0.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94d18c56f3112efa8fa227ecedf838fcdecf13cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,209,140,86,243,17,46,250,143,162,39,236,237,248,56,252,222,207,19,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
