Paul produces Hannah&amp;#039;s TV cooking show, and they must move beyond gentle barbs when she wants to know about an affair of his years ago. Mark is dying of AIDS, and his mother comes to his bedside: they must talk truthfully. Men have scalded Meredith so she rebuffs Trent&amp;#039;s charm, but he persists. The trendy, prolix Joan tries to pull the solitary Keenan into her orbit: why is he reluctant? An adulterous couple meet at hotels for evening sex, but she is unwilling for the relationship to grow. Hugh tells tall tales, usually tragic, to women in bars. By the week&amp;#039;s end, their parallel stories converge.\n\nRegion: PAL\n   \nLanguage: Dolby Digital 5.1: Spanish, English.\n\n\nSubtitles: English, Spanish, Catalanish.\n\n\nDVD9=&gt;DVD5\n\nAnyDVD, DVDRemake, DVDRebuilder+CCE 4 pass\n\n- Reduction Level for DVD-5: 78.5%\n- Overall Bitrate : 4&amp;#039;221Kbs\n- Space for Video : 3&amp;#039;601&amp;#039;948KB\n- HIGH/LOW/TYPICAL Bitrates: 5&amp;#039;789/1&amp;#039;638/4&amp;#039;221 Kbs\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145734/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145734/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc00292b9a54305e87ea543803b85c79210434e0","amp;dn":"%5BCiclo+Sean+Connery%5D+Playing+by+Heart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc00292b9a54305e87ea543803b85c79210434e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,0,41,43,154,84,48,94,135,234,84,56,3,184,92,121,33,4,52,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
