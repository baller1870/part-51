This genre-defining swashbuckler adventure was the first movie version of The Mark of Zorro. Based on the 1919 story &quot;The Curse of Capistrano&quot; by Johnston McCulley, which introduced the masked hero, Zorro, the screenplay was adapted by Fairbanks (as &quot;Elton Thomas&quot;) and Eugene Miller.\n\nNosferatu, a Symphony of Horror  is a German Expressionist film shot in 1921 by Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, and released in 1922. He had wanted to film a version of Bram Stoker&amp;#039;s Dracula, but his studio was unable to obtain the rights to the story. Murnau decided instead to film his own version with only slight changes to the story. For instance, &quot;Dracula&quot; became &quot;Nosferatu&quot; and the names of the characters changed, with Count Dracula changed to Count Orlok. The role of the vampire was played by Max Schreck. Other major actors in the film were Gustav von Wangenheim (as Thomas Hutter/Jonathan Harker), Greta SchrÃƒÂ¶der (as Ellen Hutter/Mina M. Harker), and Alexander Granach (as Knock/R.M. Renfield).\n\nModern Times is a 1936 film by Charlie Chaplin that has his famous Little Tramp character struggling to survive in the modern, industrialized world. The film is a comment on the desperate employment and fiscal conditions many people faced during the Great Depression, conditions created, in Chaplin&amp;#039;s view, by the efficiencies of modern industrialization. The movie stars Chaplin, Paulette Goddard, Henry Bergman, Stanley Sandford and Chester Conklin. It was written and directed by Chaplin.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f301767a9255460cb625ef2c4a1f5752135682e","amp;dn":"The+three+greatest+silent+films+of+all+time%2C+The+Mark+Of+Zorro%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f301767a9255460cb625ef2c4a1f5752135682e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,48,23,103,169,37,84,96,203,98,94,242,196,161,245,117,33,53,104,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
