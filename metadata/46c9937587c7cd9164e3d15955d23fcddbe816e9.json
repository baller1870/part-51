Heavy metal fans everywhere salivated at the lineup of Patton on vocals, the Melvins&amp;#039; Buzz Osborne on guitar, ex-Slayer Dave Lombardo on drums, and Mr. Bungle&amp;#039;s Trevor Dunn on bass. But as longtime fans have come to learn long ago, always expect the unexpected with Patton-related projects. The band&amp;#039;s self-titled debut (the first for Patton&amp;#039;s record label, Ipecac) is far from your conventional rock; composed and produced entirely by the singer, the songs serve as a soundtrack to a comic book&amp;#039;s story line. At nearly 43-minutes in length, Fantomas is comprised of 30 chronologically numbered &quot;pages&quot;&amp;#039; instead of songs. While it&amp;#039;s an unconventional album, it&amp;#039;s also a completely original one, especially when compared to the blah and predictable alt-rock of the late &amp;#039;90s. Patton uses his voice as an instrument with often amazing results (singing nonsensical syllables instead of words); few singers have the talent or know-how to pull off such highlights as &quot;Page 1,&quot; &quot;Page 19,&quot; &quot;Page 21,&quot; and &quot;Page 29.&quot; If you&amp;#039;re expecting an album comparable to either Faith No More or Mr. Bungle, you may be confused and disappointed. But if you&amp;#039;re looking for something completely original and cutting edge, Fantomas is highly recommended.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46c9937587c7cd9164e3d15955d23fcddbe816e9","amp;dn":"Fant%C3%B4mas+-+%28ST%29+-+1999","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46c9937587c7cd9164e3d15955d23fcddbe816e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,201,147,117,135,199,205,145,100,227,209,89,85,210,63,205,219,232,22,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
