Feuturing Jonsson from Anti cimex on bass. This was only released in 500 copies in 1982 so it is kind of a rare record. Saw this going on ebay for about $200 a while ago. I have recorded it with a technics player through an old H/K amp so I think its ok sound. This aint no pretentious shit hardcore. Simple, raw and they way it was meant to be. Just listen to the solo of Warsystem!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bbc6bf19da64fa32cb1eec9540ceb82e7572d80","amp;dn":"Skitslickers+GBG+1982+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bbc6bf19da64fa32cb1eec9540ceb82e7572d80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,188,107,241,157,166,79,163,44,177,238,201,84,12,235,130,231,87,45,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
