(many thanks DHR001!!) \n\nI have incorporated some experimental Fanedit liability protection (feedback on this would be highly useful) as well as the usual fanedit warning screen on insertion of the dvd there is also a check screen between the main menu and the movie which forces you to choose whether you own the movie or not. if you select no you get a small easter egg but cannot ultimately watch the movie as you are then returned to the 10 second warning screen. finally i have hardcoded &quot;This is a Fanedit you must own the original to legally watch this movie&quot; into the main movie stream right at the beginning. \n\n\nTime needed for the edition: Couple of weeks on and off (more on than off though) \n\npersons involved: 1 \n \nWWW.FANEDIT.ORG","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23325f08a1d3922d31068bc3c08c216d51403389","amp;dn":"Jay+%26+Silent+Bob+Strike+Back+Harder+Extended+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23325f08a1d3922d31068bc3c08c216d51403389","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,50,95,8,161,211,146,45,49,6,139,195,192,140,33,109,81,64,51,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
