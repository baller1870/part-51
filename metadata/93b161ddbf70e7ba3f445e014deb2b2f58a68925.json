MÃƒÂ¼hren says Israel was not the small innocent country \nunder existential threat from it&amp;#039;s neighbors, as has been written in our \nhistory books. &amp;#039;It was the exact opposite.&amp;#039; He describes an incident that\nIsrael created on the Syrian border. More of these incidents would later\nresult into full scale war. Israeli war hero Moshe Dayan said in a \nconversation with a journalist Rami Tal, which only got published after\nhis death, 80% of incidents were provoked by Israel. Israeli historian\nMichael Oren confirms Jordan posed no thread and was not looking for war. \n\n           .:*~*:._.:*~*:._.:*~*:.\n\nItem by NOVA (novatv.nl), VARA/NOS (Dutch Public Television)\nDutch text with English subtitles\nEnglish text with original Dutch subtitles\nBroadcasted:  June 4, 2007\nSource: Stream Rip (ASF)\nDuration: 00:12:30 (18,759 fr)\nVideo Codec: DivX 4 (OpenDivX), 320x240, 617 kb/s, 25 fps\nAudio Codec: MPEG-1 Layer 3, 128 kb/s CBR, stereo, 44100 Hz \nEng Subs by: 2wicked (using Subtitle Workshop, VirtualDub, VobSub)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93b161ddbf70e7ba3f445e014deb2b2f58a68925","amp;dn":"The+Deceptions+of+the+Six-Day+War+-+DutchTV+-+EngSubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93b161ddbf70e7ba3f445e014deb2b2f58a68925","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,177,97,221,191,112,231,186,63,68,94,1,77,235,43,47,88,166,137,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
