Everywhere a person goes (Anytown, USA) you can find a conversation taking\n\nplace about the direction our nation is heading -- keeping it&amp;#039;s sovereign status, or becoming a\n\nstate under the governance of the United Nations.\nWe, at the Militia of Montana, are dedicated to ensuring that all Americans are educated to\n\nmake an informed decision as to which direction America should go. Along with being physically\n\nprepared to withstand the onslaught which will erupt no matter where we end up, we must at all\n\ncosts, keep reaching those who have not had the opportunity to decide for themselves.\nThe Militia of Montana has been, and continues to be, a national focal point for assistiing\n\nAmericans in forming their own grass roots organization dedicated to American&amp;#039;s sovereignty and\n\nstatus as an independent nation among the nations of the world.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.militiaofmontana.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.militiaofmontana.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis download contains an extensive interview of John Trochmann who together with his brother\n\nDavid are the founders of the Militia of Montana. This is what seems to be a pretty old rip of\n\na VHS-tape. I grabbed it from the ed2k network with shareaza.\n\nThe audio and video quality is rather poor but its mostly a filmed interview and the\n\nconversation between interviewer and interviewee remains intelligible, even to people who don&amp;#039;t\n\nhave English as their mother-tongue.\n\nThe keywords that came with the file are: NWO, conspiracy, FEMA, 911, banned, secret,\n\nfreemason, illuminati. So this implies that this piece of footage is about stuff you won&amp;#039;t see\n\non the 9 o&amp;#039;clock news or Fix news.\n\nFor more info about the MOM see for instance:\n- see the enclosed .html file, a site I captured since it suspiciously kept &amp;#039;falling&amp;#039; away. So\n\nI saved it for relaxed reading.\n- http://www.npr.org/programs/atc/features/2002/sept/militia/\n\nOf course not everybody &amp;#039;likes&amp;#039; the MOM, such as (surprise surprise) the ADL: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/mom.asp?xpicked=3&amp;item=mom&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/mom.asp?xpicked=3&amp;item=mom&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDo a google search on &quot;militia of montana&quot; if you want to learn more....\n\nGeneral #0\nFileSize/String : 108 MiB\nFormat/String : Windows Media\nOveralBitRate/String : 99 Kbps\nPlayTime/String : 2h 32mn\n\nVideo #0\nCodec/String : WMV1\nCodec/Info : Windows Media Video 7\nBitRate/String : 80 Kbps\nWidth : 320\nHeight : 240\nAspectRatio/String : 4/3\n\nAudio #0\nCodec/String : WMA2\nCodec/Info : Windows Media Audio 2\nBitRate/String : 16 Kbps\nChannel(s)/String : 1 channel\nSamplingRate/String : 16 KHz\n\n================================================================================\nLearn the true nature of the world, come visit our huge dedicated e-library and forums @ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969/index.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.info/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.info/index.php&lt;/a&gt;\n================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1d1ec5f82a86edbc29b74d342a09fa17b2249ae","amp;dn":"Militia+Of+Montana+Video","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1d1ec5f82a86edbc29b74d342a09fa17b2249ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,209,236,95,130,168,110,219,194,155,116,211,66,160,159,161,123,34,73,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
