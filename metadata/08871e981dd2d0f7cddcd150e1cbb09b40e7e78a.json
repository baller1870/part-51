He sets up a team called &quot;The Hard Corps&quot;, complications arise when the boxer suspects that his sister may be in love with the bodyguard.\n\n- - - -\n\nI really enjoyed this film, not just because I&amp;#039;m a huge Van Damme fan, the story is really intense and Sheldon Lettich did a great job. Is very good to see that Van Damme is getting back, his acting is really good, and he still a great fighter. Razaaq Adoti was great too. Vivica A. Fox is sexy and perfect for her role. The Bad guys were awesome in too. The fight between Van Damme and Razaaq was very cool and real. In Hell, Wake of Death and The Hard Corps were great films.\n\nLet&amp;#039;s wait Til Death!!!\n\nI give it a 7.8/10 \n\n\navi info:\n\ndisplay preferences:\nw:576pix\nh:304pix\n\naudio preferences:\nlengh: cd1 0:54:45 &amp; cd 2 0:55:39\nbit rate: 448kb/s\n\n\nvideo preferences:\n23cps\ntransfer rate: 218kb/s\nsample rate: 12 bit\nvideo coder: Xvid codec\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08871e981dd2d0f7cddcd150e1cbb09b40e7e78a","amp;dn":"The+Hard+Corps+%282006%29+DVDRip+XviD+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08871e981dd2d0f7cddcd150e1cbb09b40e7e78a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,135,30,152,29,210,208,247,205,220,209,80,225,203,176,155,64,231,231,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
