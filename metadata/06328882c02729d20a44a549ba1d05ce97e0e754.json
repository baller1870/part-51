At the time of release, in 1995, the band were not widely know, and therefore this EP is very rare. This is one of the three EP albums that the band released prior to being signed to Roadrunner Records.\n\nThis EP features a much more raw sound than that found on later 36 Crazyfists releases, the songs are more unusual and rapcore influenced vocals are evident.\n\n[edit] Track listing\n\n   1. &quot;BullyGutt&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:17\n   2. &quot;Godline&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:13\n   3. &quot;6 Feet&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:56\n   4. &quot;KneeHigh&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:53\n   5. &quot;Happy Day Riot&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:22\n\n    * All lyrics written by Brock Lindow, all music written by 36 Crazyfists.\n\n[edit] Personnell\n\nBrock Lindow ÃƒÂ¢??
