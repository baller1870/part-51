However, it doesn&amp;#039;t deliver the blood of Mortal Kombat, the body count of Loaded, or the rampant annihilation of innocents of Die Hard Trilogy. Adding insult to injury, Project Overkill also fails to deliver the over-the-top gameplay and excitement found in those titles. While Project Overkill does indeed feature plenty of shooting and dying, players will get that gnawing been-there, done-that feeling after just a few minutes of action. \nThe four mercenaries in Project Overkill don&amp;#039;t offer the range of personalities found in Loaded. They seem like clones of each other, moving and shooting in decidedly similar ways. The few villain animations are raw (who, when hit, all &quot;splat&quot; the same way), and the stark background walls have awful, pale color schemes. Even the player&amp;#039;s character animations are sparse. In fact, the graphics in Project Overkill are so basic that this game could have easily been released on a 16-bit system and not have suffered. \n\nThe gameplay is pretty basic, too. Players are tasked with running around a series of levels, using a variety of weapons to shoot bad guys, and acquiring power-ups or keys. In this regard, Project Overkill is a Loaded-clone, but with a closer, three-quarter view, instead of overhead (walls disappear a la Die Hard, but not as conveniently; and hidden items behind them force perimeter checks). The player&amp;#039;s character can shoot in only eight directions, making sweeps impossible. These blind spots give enemies plenty of room to maneuver, and it&amp;#039;s easy to run out of ammo trying to line up a shot. Secret rooms do exist in Project Overkill, but seeking them out is not much of an incentive to slog through the bland, boring levels. \n\nRelease: 28. August 1996\n\nScreenshot:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a12778296a8e7251a6d30a894b07e7ca2cf09aa5","amp;dn":"%28PS1%29+Project+Overkill+%28PAL-E%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a12778296a8e7251a6d30a894b07e7ca2cf09aa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,39,120,41,106,142,114,81,166,211,10,137,75,7,231,202,44,240,154,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
