Stallman.\n\nHowever if tools are good enough for Business, then they are good enough for Activists, and for some jobs that need to get done, they may have to get down and dirty with the Microsoft world.\n\nHence the tools indirectly, yet kindly, provided by the rebel &quot;Dark Side&quot;, the Freed Software Movement.\n\nHere is a modest DiY Toolkit for Activists, that is available on that global communal hard-drive, reliably accessible by dialup modem to the four corners of the world, known as the ed2k (eDonkey, eMule) P2P peer-to-peer file-sharing network.\n\nPlease note that RELEASES.LST is the main resource listing of the Software Tools and Activist Media.\n\nThe RELEASES.LST displays best with GetDiZ, using the Lucida Console 10pt font, the other files, such as NFO and DiZ display better with the venerable DAMN NFO Viewer.\n\nThis is the Activist DiY Toolkit - An Inconvenient Truth - Special Edition. \n\nCredit and Kudos to many, many people, thankyou all.\n\nPlease feel free to pass on these links to those whom you think might find them of use.\n\nPlease do not include origination addresses when forwarding, thankyou.\n\nShare and Enjoy.\n\nBest Regards.\n\nATTiCUS\n\nMaycomb, Alabama.\n_______________________________________________________\n- LiBERTÃƒâ€° DiGNiTÃƒâ€° Ãƒâ€°GALiTÃƒâ€° FRATERNiTÃƒâ€° - SOCiÃƒâ€°TÃƒâ€° CiViLE -\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:627c53ebb76f7484e60094c25daa8f2cd8861a5b","amp;dn":"Activist+DiY+ToolKit+for+ed2k+P2P+DateCode+2006.11.19+-+ATTiCUS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"627c53ebb76f7484e60094c25daa8f2cd8861a5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,124,83,235,183,111,116,132,230,0,148,194,93,170,143,44,216,134,26,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
