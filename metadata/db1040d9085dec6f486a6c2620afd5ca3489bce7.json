As such, I renamed the files to match the title of the ensemble and *may* have altered the grid layout of some of them slightly, though I don&amp;#039;t recall if I did or not with any certainty. *Nothing* has been altered structurally.\n\nThis is still one of the best software synthesizers ever made and it&amp;#039;s a shame that it didn&amp;#039;t get more mainstream attention when it was still in active development. Hopefully, Dr. SynC is being well-funded at Native Instruments.\n\n\nResources: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mtu-net.ru/syncmodular/index.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mtu-net.ru/syncmodular/index.htm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kvraudio.com/get/23.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kvraudio.com/get/23.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bobhug.com/SynC/Index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bobhug.com/SynC/Index.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db1040d9085dec6f486a6c2620afd5ca3489bce7","amp;dn":"60+Ensembles+for+SynC+Modular","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db1040d9085dec6f486a6c2620afd5ca3489bce7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,16,64,217,8,93,236,111,72,106,108,38,32,175,213,202,52,137,188,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
