BRING IT BACK ---------------\n\nComedian Charlie Moreno takes real details of his troubled life to create original, brutally honest stories that may leave you feeling guilty for laughing. His stories range from his childhood living in government housing and being homeless as an adult, to dating the wrong women and television celebrities. His light hearted, yet dark and edgy material has been compared to the likes of John Leguizamo and Richard Pryor.\n  In 2001, three months after starting comedy he headed for New York City via Greyhound with only $300 in his pocket.\nCredits:\n\n Charlie Moreno has been an extra in films such as Brown Sugar, Two Weeks Notice, and Anger Management. He stars in an independent film entitled &quot;Dead Harvest&quot;.\n\nwww.charliemoreno.net\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b3ae63d43b9ef6545ff673b4e0d747f13df690f","amp;dn":"OiNK+re+upped+-+Comedian+Charlie+Moreno+-+A+Cry+For+Help+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b3ae63d43b9ef6545ff673b4e0d747f13df690f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,58,230,61,67,185,239,101,69,255,103,59,78,13,116,127,19,223,105,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
