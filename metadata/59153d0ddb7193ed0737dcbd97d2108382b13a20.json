Each provides a dazzling, panoramic survey of artists both famous and obscure and covers every region known to have nurtured the music. Volume 2 features Skip James&amp;#039;s &quot;Devil Got My Woman,&quot; and Robert Johnson&amp;#039;s &quot;Preaching&amp;#039; Blues,&quot; and Kokomo Arnold&amp;#039;s &quot;Paddlin&amp;#039; Madeline Blues.&quot; From Texas Alexander there is a version of &quot;Levee Camp Moan Blues&quot; which is made timeless by the incomparable guitar of Lonnie Johnson. Great instrumentals like Palmer McAbee&amp;#039;s &quot;Railroad Piece&quot; and the Dallas String Band&amp;#039;s &quot;Dallas Rag&quot; add spice, and there are also first-rate entries by more obscure giants like King Solomon Hill, George &quot;Bullet&quot; Williams, &quot;Hi&quot; Henry Brown, and Blind Joe Taggart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59153d0ddb7193ed0737dcbd97d2108382b13a20","amp;dn":"Various+-+The+Greatest+In+Country+Blues+Vol.+3+%281929+-+1956%29+%28SO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59153d0ddb7193ed0737dcbd97d2108382b13a20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,21,61,13,219,113,147,237,7,55,220,189,151,210,16,131,130,177,58,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
