Episode Three of the new series airs on Sunday October 28 at 8pm on BBC Two, and it&amp;#039;s set to be an absolute cracker.\n\nThe Big Race sees Hammond and a Bugatti Veyron take on a jet fighter. Yep, that&amp;#039;s plane versus car in the most horsepower-packed challenge we&amp;#039;ve ever undertaken. Don&amp;#039;t miss it.\n\nJeremy has finally lured the Ferrari 599GTB down to the Top Gear test track, but how will the front-engined V12 supercar&amp;#039;s lap time measure up?\n\nJames, as is his wont, has been sampling something a little more refined: the Rolls-Royce Drophead Coupe. That&amp;#039;s 6.7-litres of delicious British goodness... driving a convertible Roller. Sorry.\n\nWe&amp;#039;ve also got the self-parking Lexus LS600h in the studio (absolutely no potential for disaster there, naturally), as well as Lamborghini&amp;#039;s awesome Reventon: the million-Euro special-edition Murcielago that looks like a jet fighter and goes like one too.\n\nRolling Stones legend Ronnie Wood is the Star in the Reasonably Priced Car, while Isle of Man local Jeremy squeezes himself into the Isle of Man&amp;#039;s finest export: the Peel car. Never heard of it? Google it, then prepare to be amazed.
