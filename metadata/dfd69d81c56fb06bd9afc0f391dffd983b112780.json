Shiva\nNisha Kothari\t.... Sandhya\n\nDirector : Ram Gopal Varma\n\nMohit Ahlawat plays Shiva, a new recruit in the Mumbai police force. It is not long before Shiva comes face to face with the realities of the corrupt system ? cops working in complicity with gangsters, dishonest politicians using their power to serve their own interests, et al.\n\nNisha Kothari plays a crime journalist and Shiva?s love interest. Her closeness to Shiva makes Nisha, too, a target for the bad guys.\n\nThe film has lots of fights (mostly fisticuffs), chases and gory action scenes. You will see nails getting hammered into people?s head, ears getting chopped off and bones getting broken.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfd69d81c56fb06bd9afc0f391dffd983b112780","amp;dn":"Shiva.2006.Hindi.DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfd69d81c56fb06bd9afc0f391dffd983b112780","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,214,157,129,197,111,176,107,217,175,192,243,145,223,253,152,59,17,39,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
