With unobtrusive equipment and rare access to the elusive performer, he achieved a fly-on-the-wall glimpse of one of the most influential musicians of all time.Hailed as one of the best documentaries about a performing artist ever created, DONT LOOK BACK is more than a view into an extraordinary concert tour-Bob Dylan?s last as an acoustic performer. It is a window into the 60s, its spirit, and one of the poet-musicians whose words and songs defined it.\\&quot; (from the Docurama presentation)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64b0f376a4faf4b8336ec9b1e32927d2023c8f03","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Don%5C%27t+look+back","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64b0f376a4faf4b8336ec9b1e32927d2023c8f03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,176,243,118,164,250,244,184,51,110,201,177,227,41,39,210,2,60,143,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
