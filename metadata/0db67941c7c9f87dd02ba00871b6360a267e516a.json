She hates the hard work in the isolated hotel so her aunt arranges for her to look after an aging relative, Mrs. Koide, who is suffering from Alzheimer\\&amp;#039;s disease. Naomi hates this, too, but gradually becomes intrigued by the old woman and the mysteries in her past. As Naomi\\&amp;#039;s summer romance with a local boy turns sour she grows closer to the old woman and they begin to share their secrets and their dreams.\n\nFirefly Dreams is a film with deep resonance for contemporary Japan, where a huge gulf of experience separates the generation that experienced the war, and the younger rootless generations who have been raised in an era of peace, but spiritually empty materialism. The story also contrasts the divide between frenetic urban Japan and the warmth and human values found in the countryside.\n\n\nA pleasant drama movie with the typical slow pace in Japanese drama. Kinda reminds of me the movies made in 50/60\\&amp;#039;s by Ozu and Mizoguchi where Japanese tradition is kept intact and the gap between the young and older generations keeps seperating. \nThe music is rather different from other japanese movies, I liked the acoustic guitar pieces, few pieces are still ringing in my mind. Nevertheless if you like tradition japanese movies, I\\&amp;#039;m sure you will like this too as much as I did.\n\nView the trailer before you download see if it suits your preference: http://www.100meterfilms.com/firefly/en/trailer/qt.html\n\n Official site in english http://www.100meterfilms.com/firefly/en/index.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0db67941c7c9f87dd02ba00871b6360a267e516a","amp;dn":"Firefly+Dreams+%28Japan+movie%2C+2001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0db67941c7c9f87dd02ba00871b6360a267e516a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,182,121,65,199,201,248,125,208,43,160,8,113,182,54,10,38,126,81,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
