They received critical and popular acclaim internationally. They first came to notice in the UK when radio DJ John Peel played &quot;Birthday&quot;, voted by his listeners as a single of the year. The band&amp;#039;s music was characterized by psychadelic sound, whimsical yet heartfelt lyrics, and the imploring, girlish voice of vocalist BjÃƒÂ¶rk GuÃƒÂ°mundsdÃƒÂ³ttir, who later went on to great success as a solo artist. The band&amp;#039;s name was assumed by it&amp;#039;s fan&amp;#039;s to be an LSD usage reference, the drug had regained widespread popularity during while the band was releasing music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3acc38d0b5a625fe4a48f395c7062be68bd03ac","amp;dn":"THE+SUGARCUBES+-+9+Music+Videos+%28DivX%2C+640x480%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3acc38d0b5a625fe4a48f395c7062be68bd03ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,172,195,141,11,90,98,95,228,164,143,57,92,112,98,190,104,189,3,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
