As both a U.S Marine and British S.A.S. soldier fighting through an unfolding story full of twists and turns, players use sophisticated technology, superior firepower and coordinated land and air strikes on a battlefield where speed, accuracy and communication are essential to victory.\n\n\n\nHELLGATE LONDON: \n\nHellgate: London is the first original title from premier developer Flagship Studios, whose team hails from such blockbusters as the Diablo, StarCraft, and WarCraft series. Set in the near future, Hellgate: London introduces a world devastated by a demon invasion. Players are thrust into a desolate city scorched by hellfire where the survivors meld science and sorcery to gain a foothold against the minions of darkness and save the bloodline of humanity.\n\n\n\nCRYSIS:\n\nCrysis is a PC sci-fi first-person shooter from the award-winning developer Crytek, the developers of the critically acclaimed Far Cry (MC90). Earth, 2019: A colossal asteroid crashes down to Earth.\n\nThe North Korean Government quickly seals off the island chain, claiming the mysteries of the asteroid for themselves. The United States responds by dispatching an elite team of Delta Force Operators to recon the situation and report back to the Pentagon. Amid rising tensions between the US and North Koreans, the asteroid suddenly bursts open, revealing a massive, 2km high alien ship. The ship generates an immense force sphere, freezing a vast portion of the island and drastically altering the global weather system. The invasion of Earth has begun.\n\nThe two rival nations unite to stop the aliens and save mankind. The newly formed alliance fights epic battles against the marauding Aliens. With hope rapidly fading, the player must lead a crack squad through lush tropical jungle, harsh frozen landscapes, and finally into the heart of the alien ship itself for the ultimate Zero G encounter with the aliens.\n\nCrysis offers players a highly immersive FPS experience in which they will have to adapt their tactics, weaponry, armour and gameplay style to survive and defeat the alien invasion. Crysis uses the leading-edge technology of CrytekÃƒÂ¢??s proprietary engine CryENGINEÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ 2.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nPlay and enjoj  // Luma torrent works \n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f12f3074c979fe6755fd8e2963a21a61a2f95e6","amp;dn":"Lumas+demobox%3A+Call+of+duty+4+%2C+Hellgate+london+and+Crysis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f12f3074c979fe6755fd8e2963a21a61a2f95e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,18,243,7,76,151,159,230,117,95,216,226,150,58,33,166,26,47,149,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
