This fanedit got rid of all the nonsense from the original DOOM movie and happened to be a truly scary horror/action movie that was fun to watch. Unfortunatley the overall quality was just bad, so I decided to re-edit the movie based on the ideas of Scaperat. During the editing process I had to make several decisions, wether to keep or to not keep scenes, which Scaperat had used and finally my edit is a completely new fanedit of DOOM, but very much inspired by Scaperat&amp;#039;s ideas. Most important of all was for me to cut the ego-shooter-sequence, because it just did not fit to the movie, although it looked great. \n\n***************************THE EDIT**************************************\nTo create a scary and more thrilling movie out of DOOM, I had to get rid of all the nonsense , the lame jokes and the just badly acted or executed parts of the movie. Sometimes it was kind of hard to achieve, when I had to use voiceover techniques and video material from other movies to obtain what I wanted. First of all I created an all new beginning to put the audience into the right mood.The new beginning contains more overall info and therefore reduces superficiality or is at least supposed to do so. Same goes for the end sequence, which is just too much gamelike (and that is where I see the problem of the original movie: it is undecided between a video game movie and a true movie). My movie is not about the video game. Although not every rather bad scene could be removed plotwise, the deletion of the ones being cut adds a lot to the movie.\n\n***************************DVD DETAILS************************************\n96 minutes NTSC 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with AC3-5.1 audio and a vbr of 4.500KB/s using a 3 pass encoding with CCE.\nLanguages         : ENGLISH GERMAN\nSubtitles         : ENGLISH\nMENUS             : All animated\nSCENE SELECTION   : yes\nDELETED SCENES    : yes, 2\nCOVER ART         : yes, on DVD-Rom part\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++ABOUT FANEDITS+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nSome of you might think that the universe is solid and nothing can be changed the way nature has made it. Genetics should have proven you wrong already.\nBut still some you believe that a movie, which is not so much of a universe in itself should  not be altered,is supposed to be the way it is. The CBB group disagrees with you in that totally. When a director along with his executive producers and his producers and the many more people having a say in making a movie and being responsible or taking responsiblity for a cut, decide to have a movie this or that way, they have no idea if the outcome is good or will be liked or not. Quality cannot be just created, it is far more than a few good ideas put together. We all have seen great efforts who failed in the end (best example might be Matrix Revolutions). Now are we forced to accept that a movie stays the way it is?\nThe movie stations make their personal cuts, the studios do, the producers do, the directors do and finally we have 10 different versions of the same movie material (e.G.Dawn of the Dead). Is this bad? No. It is very good this way, because the watcher, YOU, can decide, what you like best. And the CBB group thinks that touching movie material, altering it to get a new result, which could be highly enjoyable, not to joke around or make fun, but seriously tell the known story in an unknown way, can be considered  for viewing pleasure and therefore done.\n\nFIND OUT MORE ABOUT FANEDITS:\nWWW.FANEDITED.COM\nWWW.FANEDIT.ORG","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22bad44628e43404d4bdb9292da5c55439c6816b","amp;dn":"DOOM+-+The+Posessed+Re-Cut.CBB.DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22bad44628e43404d4bdb9292da5c55439c6816b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,186,212,70,40,228,52,4,212,189,185,41,45,165,197,84,57,198,129,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
