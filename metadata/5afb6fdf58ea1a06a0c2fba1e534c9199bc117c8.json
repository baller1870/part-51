The majority of the books are classical literary works written by the greatest authors of the last few centuries 20th century included. My basic principle when compiling this collection was to provide all texts in original if possible, and at least one translation. However, it was not possible to strictly follow this principle, so that you will find a lot of books that are available only in original, but also such that are present only in translation. The languages represented are only those that I understand and can read, which are: English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Russian, Spanish and Swedish. Apart from artistic literature there are also some non-fiction books, mostly on humanistic subjects, such as theory of literature, linguistics &amp; language learning, philosophy and some marginal to these like history and psychology. The books are stored in several file formats to the using of which I also provide the necessary applications in a separate folder within the archive (apart from those widely used programs like Acrobat Reader for instance, that are freely downloadable from the Internet).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5afb6fdf58ea1a06a0c2fba1e534c9199bc117c8","amp;dn":"Multilingual+library%2C+old+%26+modern+classics+in+original+and+tran","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5afb6fdf58ea1a06a0c2fba1e534c9199bc117c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,251,111,223,88,234,26,6,160,194,251,161,229,52,201,25,155,193,23,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
