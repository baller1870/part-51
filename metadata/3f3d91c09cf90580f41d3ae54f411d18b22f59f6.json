We first meet John Wilson (Mark Shannon) a conceited hotel developer trying to find a boat to take him to Cat Island. The very name brings about superstition, as it is rumor to be cursed. Luckily enough John comes across a stocky boat captain named Larry (played by writer George Eastman of Bronx Warriors fame) who agrees to take him to Cat Island if he finances the trip. \n\nOnce the group arrives at the island they meet opposition from an elderly man and an exotic ghostly apparition (Laura Gemser) who warns of great danger. Unbeknownst of the resurrected zombies the group goes about their business planning to erect a luxury resort before they find themselves at the wake of an island infested with hungry corpses. \n\n\nwatch if you dare/FFF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f3d91c09cf90580f41d3ae54f411d18b22f59f6","amp;dn":"Erotic+Nights+Of+The+Living+Dead-Joe+D%5C%27amato+%281980%29...FFF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f3d91c09cf90580f41d3ae54f411d18b22f59f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,61,145,192,156,249,5,128,244,29,58,229,79,65,29,24,178,47,89,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
