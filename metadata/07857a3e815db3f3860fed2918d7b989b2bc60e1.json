This is an old-school roleplaying game.  You create a Party of up to 6 members, choosing from 11 races and 14 character classes.  The Party remains with you through the entirety of the adventure.  No party-NPCs.  It is a 2-Dimensional engine, not the fancy 3-D Engine of today.  However, the world-size is immense, alot larger than any game I know of.  You will be lost for hours playing this game, definitely the best RPG ever created in 2-D.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07857a3e815db3f3860fed2918d7b989b2bc60e1","amp;dn":"WizardryGold","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07857a3e815db3f3860fed2918d7b989b2bc60e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,133,122,62,129,93,179,243,134,15,237,41,24,215,185,137,178,188,96,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
