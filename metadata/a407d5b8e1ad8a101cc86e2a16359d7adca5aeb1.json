At least for the casual visitor and the local sheriff, Daniel Gillis. However, all of a sudden, there are a lot of strange murders where strangers or people passing through are killed by mobs of townspeople. Only Sheriff Gillis has no clue to what&amp;#039;s going on. Fortunately, the town has an excellent undertaker, William G. Dobbs, who is happy to take care of this sudden death-wave which is good for his business. Gillis soon discovers clues that lead to many of the local inhabitants involved in the killings, including his own wife Janet.\nUser Rating: 6.5/10 \n\nNTSC - 16/9 - 5.1 - No Subs\n\nJTFM\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Dead-Buried-Limited-Numbered-copies/dp/B00009WNXA/ref=sr_1_1/002-6839766-4546459?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1193071586&amp;sr=1-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Dead-Buried-Limited-Numbered-copies/dp/B00009WNXA/ref=sr_1_1/002-6839766-4546459?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1193071586&amp;sr=1-1&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a407d5b8e1ad8a101cc86e2a16359d7adca5aeb1","amp;dn":"Dead+%26+Buried+-+JTFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a407d5b8e1ad8a101cc86e2a16359d7adca5aeb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,7,213,184,225,173,138,16,28,200,110,42,22,53,157,122,220,165,174,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
