John Morghen (AKA Giovanni Lombardo Radice) stars as a drug-crazed, womanizing lout, and porn star Robert Kerman (the star of Deodato&amp;#039;s film) turns up as a world-weary New York detective.\n\nCannibal Ferox was released uncut on video in England circa 1982 by Replay, but the film&amp;#039;s transgressive imagery prompted it to be quickly banned under the Obscene Publications Act, finding itself languishing for years on the video nasties list. \n\n\nlater/FFF\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77a5dbf631e383b521ad8c771958465c4a56da5a","amp;dn":"Cannibal.Ferox+%281981%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77a5dbf631e383b521ad8c771958465c4a56da5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,165,219,246,49,227,131,181,33,173,140,119,25,88,70,92,74,86,218,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
