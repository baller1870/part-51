Rating:  \n \n  3.9 / 5 (based on 14 ratings). What did you think of it?  \n\nPlot: One of the Venoms is killed, and the other four plan an elaborate sting operation to get revenge. \n \nOverview: Set in the early 20th century, the plot involves corrupt military men and civil war and is all shot on Shaw Bros. studio sets. One of the Venom characters gets killed halfway through the film, so the other four plan an elaborate sting operation to get revenge. They use the dead man&amp;#039;s money and bankbook to put one over on General Han by making Lu Feng out to be some top official&amp;#039;s son. They claim they&amp;#039;ve got weapons to sell to the general, but all they have to show are a machine gun and two pistols, which were actually lifted by the boys from an armory in an abortive robbery attempt. At some point the general&amp;#039;s men receive the robbery report and put two and two together. \n \nCast: Lo Meng  ||  Chiang Sheng  ||  Wong Lik  ||  Sun Chien  ||  Lu Feng  ||  Phillip Kwok  ||  Chui Tai Ping  ||  Chan Shen  ||  Wang Han Chen  ||  Yeung Hung  ||  Tam Jan Dung  ||  Walter Tso Tat-Wah  ||  Ng Hong Sang  ||  Paul Wong Kwan  ||  Wan Seung Lam  ||  Lam Wai  ||  Lau Fong Sai  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.543522/qx/details.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.543522/qx/details.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n_________________\nDo not break the share chain!
