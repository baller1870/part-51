Also if a full line of stone blocks is formed they will disappear in a similar fashion to Tetris and also add to the player&amp;#039;s score.\n\nThe game&amp;#039;s name comes from its mascot which is a super deformed version of queen Cleopatra. Additionally the game utilizes an Egyptian theme.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7a39c5c97c0ca4a6cd231a0c08c525d8b62b44d","amp;dn":"Cleopatra+Fortune+%28Dreamcast%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7a39c5c97c0ca4a6cd231a0c08c525d8b62b44d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,163,156,92,151,192,202,74,108,210,49,160,192,140,82,93,139,98,180,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
