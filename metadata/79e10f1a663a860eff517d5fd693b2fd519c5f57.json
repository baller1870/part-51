The movie inspired this short-lived sitcom. \nThis sitcom starring the Canadian-Greek comedienne premiered on CBS on February 24,2003. \nShe is Nia Portakolos married to Ian,an all-American man(Steven Eckholdt). John Corbett,\nwho played Ian in the film already had a show of his own,HBO&amp;#039;s recently cancelled \n&quot;Sex In The City&quot;,so he contractually could not do MBFGL. Also part of the TV cast \nwho also appeared in the film are Gia Carides as Nia&amp;#039;s sister,Michael Constantine \nas the father and Lainie Kazan as the mother. In every episode there are several \nflashbacks to Nia&amp;#039;s childhood with her much younger mom and dad. Rita Wilson served \nas executive producer as she did for the movie. In addition to Wilson,other memorable \nguest appearances were made by Joey Fatone of the singing group NSync,who also appeared \nin the film as Angelo,and Frank Stallone,who&amp;#039;s Sylvester&amp;#039;s brother. After 6 or 7 episodes,\nCBS pulled the plug on this sitcom.\n\nFormer releses from me on TPB:\nVarannan vecka DVD-9\nStockholm Boogie \nTjenare Kungen\nLed Zeppelin PAL - DVD 1 of 2\nLed Zeppelin PAL - DVD 2 of 2\nVideodrome - PAL DVD - A seed for pamparius\nThe Black Sabbath Story - Vol 1: 1970-1978 PAL DVD\nCinema Paradiso [DIRECTOR&amp;#039;S CUT] PAL DVD\nR E M - In View: The Best of R E M 1988-2003 - PAL DVD\nThe POLICE-Every Breath You Take - PAL DVD + Cover\nThe Cure - Trilogy - PAL DVD 2 of 2\nThe Cure - Trilogy - PAL DVD 1 of 2\nBill Wyman s (The Rolling Stones) Blues Odyssey - PAL DVD + COVER\nPunk Generation - PAL DVD\nThe Clash - Rude Boy: Special Edition PAL DVD\nMad Max 1 - PAL DVD - SWESUB\nBruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band: Live In Barcelona 2 of 2 - PAL DVD\nBruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band: Live In Barcelona 1 of 2 - PAL DVD\nThe Who - The Kids Are Alright Disc 2 (Special Edition) 1979 NTSC DVD\nThe Who - The Kids Are Alright Disc 1 (Special Edition) 1979 NTSC DVD\nThe Pink Floyd and Syd Barrett Story - PAL - DVD\nZiggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars - The Motion Picture - PAL DVD\nSimon &amp; Garfunkel - The Concert in Central Park 1981 - PAL DVD\nGimme Some Truth - John Lennons Imagine Documentary PAL DVD\nPopulÃƒÂ¤rmusik FrÃƒÂ¥n Vittula 2004 SWEDISH - SUOMALAINEN FULL DVD-9\nThe Blue Light - Ao no hono-o - PAL DVD\nDIVA - PAL DVD\nTommy The Movie - 1975 - PAL DVD\nDeep Purple - Heavy Metal Pioneers - NTSC DVD\nThe Beatles - The First U.S Visit - PAL DVD\nWoodstock - PAL DVD\nRolling Stones Live at the Max - PAL DVD\nBob Dylan MTV UNPLUGGED - PAL DVD\nThe Ring - PAL DVD SCANDINAVIAN SUB\nRing 0 Birthday - PAL DVD NORDIC SUB\nRing 2 - PAL DVD NORDIC SUB\nBreaking Point.1975 - Svensktextad\nBulletproof Monk - PAL DVD NORDIC SUBS\nAntikiller - PAL DVD NORDIC SUBS\nA Man Called Hero - Zhong hua ying xiong PAL DVD\nThe Filth and the Fury&quot;Sex Pistols Documentary&quot; PAL DVD\nThe Twilight Samurai - Tasogare Seibei\nDawn of the Dead 2004 /NORDIC SUB/PAL/\nRed Lion - Akage\nBichunmoo - Flying Warriors\nCradle 2 the Grave\nShogun Assassin\n2046\nTai Chi Master\nHair 1979\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79e10f1a663a860eff517d5fd693b2fd519c5f57","amp;dn":"My+Big+Fat+Greek+Life+%28PAL+DVD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79e10f1a663a860eff517d5fd693b2fd519c5f57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,225,15,26,102,58,134,14,255,81,125,95,214,147,178,253,81,156,95,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
