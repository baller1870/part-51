All they want is to re-start the silent machines. But this simple act - the take - has the power to turn the globalization debate on its head. Armed only with slingshots and an abiding faith in shop-floor democracy, the workers face off against the bosses, bankers and a whole system that sees their beloved factories as nothing more than scrap metal for sale. With The Take, director Avi Lewis, one of Canada&amp;#039;s most outspoken journalists, and writer Naomi Klein, author of the international bestseller No Logo, champion a radical economic manifesto for the 21st century.\n\nIn Spanish with English subtitles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb53d43fb7cfa2af74efab8244cacf7361526553","amp;dn":"The+Take+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb53d43fb7cfa2af74efab8244cacf7361526553","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,83,212,63,183,207,162,175,116,239,171,130,68,202,207,115,97,82,101,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
