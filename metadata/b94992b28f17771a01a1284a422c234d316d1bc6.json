Betty Ting Pei, the woman in whose apartment Bruce Lee died, stars as herself in the story of her relationship with the international action icon. Danny Lee - who was to find even greater fame in such classics as John Woo&amp;#039;s &quot;The Killer&quot;, Liu Chia-liang&amp;#039;s &quot;Tiger On The Beat 2&quot;, and his self-directed true crime thrillers &quot;Dr. Lamb&quot; - wisely chooses not to try an impersonation of Bruce. Instead he just holds on tight as the fascinating expose unfolds. The international title, &quot;Bruce Lee: His Last Days, His Last Nights&quot;, might give you an idea of the action in store, as Betty &quot;strips away&quot; the rumors to reveal her version of the truth...among other things. John Lo Mar, who loved making wall-to-wall, streamlined, kung-fu-crammed action films, works with esteemed martial arts instructors Tang Chia and Yuen Woo-ping to make the fight action as interesting as the rest.\n\nCast: \tBetty Ting Pei  ||  Danny Lee Sau-Yin  ||  Wong San  ||  Yuen Cheung Yan  ||  Gam Dai  ||  Shut Ma (Wa Lung)  ||  Tony Liu (Jun Guk)  ||  Chan Lau  ||  Tino Wong Cheung  ||  Chow Yun Gin  ||  Yuen Shun-Yi  ||  Lee Chiu  ||  Chin Yuet Sang  ||  Corey Yuen Kwai  ||  Alan Chui (Chung San) \n\n_________________\nDo not break the share chain!
