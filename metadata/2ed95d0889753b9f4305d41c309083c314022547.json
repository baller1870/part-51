This is the working recordings\nfor the second. Two tracks were donated to the Beach Boys\nL.A. lp. Carry Me Home was a left-over from the Holland\nlp.\nThe audio quality is midrange to excellent.\nFrom my research the only reason the Lp has not\nbeen issued it that James Guercio owns the tapes\nin lew of payment for the sessions.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ed95d0889753b9f4305d41c309083c314022547","amp;dn":"Dennis+Wilson+-+Bamboo+-+unreleased+Lp+-+RARE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ed95d0889753b9f4305d41c309083c314022547","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,217,93,8,137,117,59,159,67,5,212,28,48,144,131,195,20,2,37,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
