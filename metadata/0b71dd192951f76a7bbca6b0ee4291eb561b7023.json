It was illustrated by Arthur Rackham in 1899 and 1909.\n\nThe book reduced the archaic English and complicated storyline of Shakespeare to a simple level that children could read and comprehend. However, as noted in the Author&amp;#039;s Preface, &quot;his words are used whenever it seemed possible to bring them in; and in whatever has been added to give them the regular form of a connected story, diligent care has been taken to select such words as might least interrupt the effect of the beautiful English tongue in which he wrote: therefore, words introduced into our language since his time have been as far as possible avoided.&quot;\n\nMary Lamb was responsible for most of the comedies, perhaps 14 of the 20.\n\nThe 20 stories adapted from the selected plays were:\n\n    * 1 - The Tempest\n    * 2 - A Midsummer Night&amp;#039;s Dream\n    * 3 - Winter&amp;#039;s Tale\n    * 4 - Much Ado About Nothing\n    * 5 - As You Like It\n    * 6 - Two Gentlemen of Verona\n    * 7 - Merchant of Venice\n    * 8 - Cymbeline\n    * 9 - King Lear\n    * 10 - Macbeth\n    * 11 - All&amp;#039;s Well That Ends Well\n    * 12 - Taming of the Shrew\n    * 13 - Comedy of Errors\n    * 14 - Measure for Measure\n    * 15 - Twelfth Night\n    * 16 - Timon of Athens\n    * 17 - Romeo and Juliet\n    * 18 - Hamlet, Prince of Denmark\n    * 19 - Othello\n    * 20 - Pericles, Prince of Tyre\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b71dd192951f76a7bbca6b0ee4291eb561b7023","amp;dn":"Audiobook+-+Tales+from+Shakespeare+-+Charles+and+Mary+Lamb+%5BLibr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b71dd192951f76a7bbca6b0ee4291eb561b7023","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,113,221,25,41,81,247,106,123,188,166,176,238,66,145,235,86,27,112,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
