These weapons may seem like cutting edge technology, but the ancient Chinese invented these weapons--in some cases thousands of years ago. Host Michael Guillen will demonstrate how the ancient Chinese repeating crossbow was a clear precursor to the machine gun and we&amp;#039;ll see how, more than a thousand years earlier, the Chinese invented a weapon that rivaled the European cannon. Explore how ancient Chinese armies developed battlefield strategies that shape how we go to war today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f0eaf172cda33fc00b419cca39b81b214cddc8f","amp;dn":"Where+Did+It+Come+From+China+The+Personal+Weapon+DSR+XviD+THOR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f0eaf172cda33fc00b419cca39b81b214cddc8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,14,175,23,44,218,51,252,0,180,25,204,163,155,129,178,20,205,220,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
