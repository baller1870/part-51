It is unusual among the recent releases in that the English and Japanese titles are not similar in meaning; its Japanese title could be rendered as Bewitching Dream.\n\nAs the month turns to May, winter has lasted far longer than normal in Gensokyo;, and the denizens begin to suspect foul play. As Reimu, Marisa or the new arrival Sakuya Izayoi, the player embarks on a search for those who are working to prevent spring\\\\\\&amp;#039;s coming.\n\nPerfect Cherry Blossom continues the tradition of the Touhou games, the reappearance of former bosses as playable characters. Sakuya was the maid of vampire Remilia Scarlet, better known as the Scarlet Devil, and the player fought her several times in EoSD.\n\nThere is an English translation patch available here: http://www.pooshlmer.com/touhouwiki/index.php?title=Perfect_Cherry_Blossom:_English_patch","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abba9120a206e2339204e94cf8162aac51ce671b","amp;dn":"Perfect+Cherry+Blossom+%28Japanese+Shmup%2FManic+Shooter%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abba9120a206e2339204e94cf8162aac51ce671b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,186,145,32,162,6,226,51,146,4,233,76,248,22,42,172,81,206,103,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
