He journeys through Poland from the port of Gdansk on the Baltic Sea to the Slovakian border to the south of the Tatra Mountains, considering on his trip the upheavals that have traumatised Poland for 70 years. Palin visits Auschwitz and Czestechowa, meets the leader of trade union Solidarity, Lech Walesa, and marvels at Warsaw, razed to the ground on Hitler&amp;#039;s orders and restored to its old glory brick by brick from original plans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca8e8401382a1d8ab148ab1a8ee359da94421c0c","amp;dn":"Michael+Palin%5C%27s+New+Europe+-+s01e06","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca8e8401382a1d8ab148ab1a8ee359da94421c0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,142,132,1,56,42,29,138,177,72,171,26,142,227,89,218,148,66,28,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
