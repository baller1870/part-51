With more edge than standard radio pop, the band offers a poppy punch which flirts with pop punk, though never makes the commitment to the sound. The result is a sound between the Posies and Green Day, and should be able to satisfy both indie rockers and low-key punks at once.\n\n\nTRACK LISTING\n\n01.
