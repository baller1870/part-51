You&amp;#039;re just playing the old songs using a new engine *yawn.*\n\n\n\nSo I took it upon myself to make my own version of Guitar Hero 2, with only a few songs replaced with songs from the 360 version.  I also made sure to replace songs with similarly-setup songs, to make sure co-op still worked.\n\n\n\nI&amp;#039;m not going to post a multi-gigabyte torrent of an ISO, instead, I&amp;#039;m gonna do one better: this torrent contains songs from the XBox 360 version of Guitar Hero 2, all converted and ready to insert into your own custom version of Guitar Hero 2.\n\n\n\nThere are instructions available here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scorehero.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5925&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scorehero.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5925&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAlso, for doing custom names:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scorehero.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=215116&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scorehero.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=215116&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nThis package contains anything you&amp;#039;d need to download to do this, including the elusive Guitar Hero Explorer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0eebca1612659897f31514b7130a861db14173ae","amp;dn":"Guitar+Hero+2+360+to+PS2+Conversions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0eebca1612659897f31514b7130a861db14173ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,235,202,22,18,101,152,151,243,21,20,183,19,10,134,29,177,65,115,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
