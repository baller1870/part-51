Although Erlang has been around for almost ten years now, it became a rather popular programming environment for communication platforms only recently.\n\nThe talk will equip the open-minded programmer with concepts of concurrent programming in a functional programming environment supported by real-world examples.\n\nDespite the fact that actual code fragments will be in display, there is no need for novices and non-programmers to be scared away.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19d8f22bbbad211ec72090bbdcbcfbe289a10076","amp;dn":"24c3-2216-de-erlang.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19d8f22bbbad211ec72090bbdcbcfbe289a10076","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,216,242,43,187,173,33,30,199,32,144,187,220,188,251,226,137,161,0,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
