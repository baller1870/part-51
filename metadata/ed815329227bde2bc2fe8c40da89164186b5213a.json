Many great arts came\nout of rough times throughout history when\nartists were heavily influenced and inspired\nby the surrounding situation. It is human\nnature to express their feelings and reflect\ntheir ideologies through actions. Artists\npaint and sculpt to express, musicians make\nmusic, and writers write stories. Even\npartying is a form of expression, especially\nfor the psytrance scene where party becomes a\nritual.\nRecent history tells us that oppression leads\nto revolution. When people become too\noppressed they change. We are living in a\nhigh-tech super-information age; everyone is\noverexposed to information either directly or\nindirectly. It does not matter if you live in\nthe city or countryside; there is no escape\nin our daily life. Media becomes the\nsuper-powerful weapon that can hit and\npenetrate any age and culture group, the\nmaster of media can possibly control the\nworld and leave a great impact on humanity.\nPresidential election, war coverage, reality\nTV and infomercial: are they the sugar coated\npropaganda force feeding the uninitiated\npublic? Fear and intolerance levels are\nrising; stability and comfort levels are\ndecreasing, what causes that? Is the world\nruled by greedy egotistic maniacs?\nOur time is getting darker and darker; we are\nreaching the threshold crossover to another\nera. Perhaps a huge explosion would be the\nremedy for our rotting race. Like a gigantic\nalarm clock to wake up the sleeping souls to\nre-enter the hosts to revive our\nconsciousness to relearn the true meaning of\nlife. May be we are like the phoenix; we must\ndie in order to be born again.\nFried Babas have carefully chosen 10 special\nweapons (special alarm clocks) created by\nartists from different corners of the world.\nEach weapon will lead you into the darkest\nrealms, conjure the most fearful demons to\ndemolish your egos and wipe out your inner\nuniverse. We aim to destroy everything and\nanything you know. Hopefully when you come\nback to your senses again you will have many\nquestions that need to be answered.\nImportant Notice      \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed815329227bde2bc2fe8c40da89164186b5213a","amp;dn":"%5BPSYCHODELIC%5DVA_-_Weapons_Of_Mass_Destruction-2007-UPE.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed815329227bde2bc2fe8c40da89164186b5213a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,129,83,41,34,123,222,43,194,254,140,64,218,137,22,65,134,181,33,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
