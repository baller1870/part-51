From the existence of a secret society said to guard the secrets of Jesus Christ&amp;#039;s bloodline to Da Vinci&amp;#039;s alleged clues placed within his paintings, the National Geographic team speaks with scholars from around the globe to find out what measure of truth Brown&amp;#039;s book holds, and why some believe that the descendants of Jesus exist to this very day. \nWere Jesus and Mary Magdalene actually married with children? Do their descendants still walk the earth today? Has a secret society called the Priory of Sion existed since the time of the Knights Templar and do they hold the secret to the bloodline of Jesus Christ? Could the infamous quest for the Holy Grail relate to this secret? And did Leonardo Da Vinci know the answers to all of these questions and hide clues for the rest of us in his art? In short, is any of Dan Brown?s international bestseller The Da Vinci Code real? National Geographic Channel?s hit series, ?Is it Real?? seeks the true answers.\nNational Geographic takes you around the globe and behind the sensationalism to sort the fact from the fiction, as noted experts, hard core sceptics and dedicated believer&amp;#039;s search for the realty behind one of the most phenomenal, and controversial, bestsellers ever published.\n\nWWW.SOLODVD.ORG","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d497d84cfc0d89be4308f7e9e4ef039c3440847","amp;dn":"Da+Vinci%5C%27s+Code+National+Geographic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d497d84cfc0d89be4308f7e9e4ef039c3440847","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,73,125,132,207,192,216,155,228,48,143,126,158,78,240,57,195,68,8,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
