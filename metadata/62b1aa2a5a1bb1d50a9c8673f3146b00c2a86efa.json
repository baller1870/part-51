Supernaturally evil.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nIn the beginning of the times, God created life into universe: light gave birth to angels, earth to men and fire to djin, creatures condemned to dwell in the void between the worlds. One who wakes a djin shall be given three wishes. Upon granting the third, an unholy legion of djins are freed through a doorway between the worlds upon the Earth. In 1127 A.D., in Persia, a sorcerer lures and traps a powerful Djinn in the stone of secret fire. In the present days, a drunken crane operator drops the valuable statue of Ahura Mazda over the assistant of Raymond Beaumont on the harbor, and one worker finds the huge and priceless opal red stone where Djin is seized. Alexandra Amberson, who works in an auction house, receives the stone for evaluation and accidentally awakes Djin. The evil creature is released later, charges the stone with people souls and feeds with their fears, while chasing Alexandra to force to make three wishes and unleash the demoniac fiends upon Earth.\n\nThe Djinn is a mischievous monster who can fulfill any wishes but in a horrible way (for example, when the woman tells him her wish to be beautiful forever, she is turned to mannequin). He was captured into an opal in the 12th century and hidden inside an antique statue. When the statue is damaged in 1997 during transportation to Los Angeles, Djinn escapes and takes human form. Young gemologist Alexandra Amberson has to take a stand against him. Written by Anonymous \n\nIn ancient Persia, an evil creature called the Djinn wreaks havoc on a local kingdom before being sealed inside a stone - a fire opal. Centuries later, the stone, encased in a statue, is discovered when the statue is broken apart in a loading accident. A young gemologist, Alexandra Amberson, examines the jewel to appraise it. But she unwittingly awakes the horrible Djinn inside. Soon the Djinn is loose on the streets, twisting people\\'s wishes and and killing them so he can steal their souls. Eventually the Djinn disguises himself as an elegant man-about-town, Nathaniel Demarest. In both human &amp; Djinn form, he pursues Alexandra to trick her into making three wishes, to enable his unholy legions to conquer the Earth.........\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDVD-RETAIL\n\nRunning Time: 90min\n\nVersion: 16:9 Widescreen\n\nAudio: 5.1 Dolby Digital \n\nEdition: Digitally  Mastered\n\n-----------------------------\nAnimated Interaactive  Menus\n\nScene Access\n\nTheatrical Teaser and Trailer\n\nDirectorÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™?ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s Commentary Track\n\nDocumentary\n\nBehind-the-Scenes Footage\n\nNo subs\n-----------------------------\n\nPLEASE KEEP SEEDING and WHISHMASTER 2 will soon arrive.........","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62b1aa2a5a1bb1d50a9c8673f3146b00c2a86efa","amp;dn":"WHISHMASTER+1997+-+DVD-RETAIL-NTSC---TAMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62b1aa2a5a1bb1d50a9c8673f3146b00c2a86efa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,177,170,42,90,27,177,213,10,156,134,115,243,20,107,0,194,168,110,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
