I\\&amp;#039;m definitely in the former category. So sadly haven missed this special when it was on cable, I was over-enthusiastic to get it when it came out on DVD earlier this week. Some of the material almost had me in tears. Not sad tears, mind you. I heard some repeated variations off his older material (the dream movie bit), but for the most part it\\&amp;#039;s new material (to me anyways). So yeah, I enjoyed it very much. If you want a good laugh, rent/buy this one now. Also as an added bonus you get his short film \\&quot;One Soldier\\&quot; and small clips of one of his shows in \\&amp;#039;88\n\n\nEnjoy! :)\n\n\nTuberok\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0edeaf71c9b9d1c5ca7fd01d0cd4cdaaf4bab679","amp;dn":"Steven+Wright+-+When+Leaves+Blow+Away+-+Please+Seed+-+8-30-07+-+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0edeaf71c9b9d1c5ca7fd01d0cd4cdaaf4bab679","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,222,175,113,201,185,209,197,202,127,208,29,12,212,205,170,244,186,182,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
