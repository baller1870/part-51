Repression that is usually instigated by those who claim to have a monopoly of communication with god ! \n\nAlthough most recently Islam has become the face of much dogmatism and brutality, but Christian and Jewish faithfuls show the same narrow and exclusive view of &quot;others&quot; (including non-believers) as faithful Muslems do....\n\nIn any case, it is a good watch, and bound to make one think about foundations of one&amp;#039;s beliefs.  It is an engaging film so can be watched alone, or in a group - to discuss what, if any, of his positions are acceptable (or not) and why.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7313452b0bb1732c38d9abd6f43f7a8cb5a4b0bb","amp;dn":"The+Root+of+All+Evil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7313452b0bb1732c38d9abd6f43f7a8cb5a4b0bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,19,69,43,11,177,115,44,56,217,171,214,244,63,122,140,181,164,176,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
