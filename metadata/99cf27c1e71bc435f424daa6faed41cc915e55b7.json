The game is still in it&amp;#039;s beta phase\nand is to be considered *unfinished* software for the moment. This release\nfeatures only a few early levels, but more content is planned to be added as new\nversions of the game are released. By the time of release of version 1.0.0,\nAction Cyborg should have matured into a full game with complete levels and\ncontent. But for now, that still lies in an unknown future!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe background story\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe story takes place in a dark, technological future, which is actually not\nmuch further away than one or two centuries from now. The improvement of\ntechnology and endlessly expanding powers of mega-corporations has led to a\nsevere decay of mankind, resulting in people of lower social status living under\nmore or less miserable circumstances in the unimaginable big cities. The\ntechnology is, however, available to absolutely anyone because of it&amp;#039;s cheap\nprice. Walk right out in the street and you can buy the latest military\ntechnology, computers, synthetic drugs and weapons for a non-important price.\nAnd you will need it, unless you want the next person ending your life just so\nhe can scavenge on what little you have left.\n\nYou play a cyborg (cybernetic organism), a human being who through implants and\ntechnological modifications has had his body and reflexes enhanced for superior\nstrength and agility. Our hero is not an AI (artificial intelligence) however.\nHe was once a human being, just like anyone else, before his kalcium-based\nskeleton was swapped for solid aluminium, muscles injected with synthetic\nsteroid hormones, heart exchanged for an electronic pump and eyes replaced with\nSony colour-videolenses. He is not immortal though. His flesh is still sensitive\nto heat, and the bullet from a gun would still splice his nervous system and\nresult in a collapse.\n\nThis may not have been something our hero wished for. It is very much possible\nthat he once suffered a nearly fatal attack on himself, and ended up either\ncrippled for life or with his brain in a glass jar. And it&amp;#039;s very possible that\nhe would still be there, had he not done this transformation.\n\nNow, positioned in the streets and surroundings of BAMA (the Boston-Atlanta\nMetropolitan Axis), aka &quot;The Sprawl&quot;, our hero is set out on a vigilantistic\nmission of both survival and revenge.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHow to play the game\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen you launch the executable, you are presented with the title screen and main\nmenu. Navigate the menu with UP and DOWN arrow keys, and select an option with\nENTER. You can always go back to this menu by pressing ESCAPE after you have\nlaunched a new game.\n\nThe in-game controls are very easy. Move the cyborg left and right with the LEFT\nand RIGHT arrow keys. Press Z to make him jump, and X to fire the weapon. You\ncan swap weapons with 1, 2, 3 and 4. You can only swap to a weapon if you have\npicked it up, so if you press 2 (for shotgun) and nothing happens, then you need\nto find and pick up a shotgun first.\n\nYou complete a level by reaching the exit (usually the far right end of the\nlevel), and you are automatically taken to the next level when doing so.\n\nThe enemies (everyone but you!) will do their best to stop you from reaching the\nexit. They will try to kill you on sight by fireing their weapons at you. You\ncan respond to this by shooting back and killing them, or you can try to run\npast them if you have ran out of ammunition, or if there are too many of them.\n\nDo your best to avoid getting hit by their bullets, or you will take severe\ndamage. You can find and pick up medkits to restore your health back to normal.\nIf you get hit by an explosive rocket (fired by enemy cyborgs armed with rocket\nlaunchers), you are instantly killed.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTroubleshooting\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAction Cyborg is still beta software and far away from bug-free, but is\nguaranteed to not contain any code that would seriously damage your computer\nor operating system. It does not attempt to access any files outside it&amp;#039;s\ndirectory, and neither does it contain any file-altering code, except for the\nscreenshot function (accessed by pressing F12).\n\nIf for some reason the executable doesn&amp;#039;t run, please examine the file\nerrorlog.txt first and see if it has reported something. There could be a file\nmissing, or you could have unpacked the game in a wrong way. If it still doesn&amp;#039;t\nwork and errorlog.txt reports nothing (or it&amp;#039;s not there), then please e-mail me\nand inform me of the problem, and of your computer setup and operating system.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nContact information\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you&amp;#039;re having problems with Action Cyborg, have found a bug, would like to\nsuggest something, or if you just wanna let us know how good (or BAD!) you think\nthe game is, then please e-mail me (John Karlgren, the programmer) on address:\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;f09389929f8297b0849582829f8280859e9b83899e949993918495de9f8297de&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nAlso, you can always get the latest version of Action Cyborg at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.terrorpunksyndicate.org/actioncyborg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.terrorpunksyndicate.org/actioncyborg/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDeveloper credits\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGame engine and level editor programming by John Karlgren\nGraphics by Joel SegerbÃƒÂ¤ck\nAdditional graphics by John Karlgren\nMusic and sound effects production by Terror Punk Syndicate\nAdditional sound effects were taken from various royalty-free sources\nBeta levels (&quot;Night City&quot;, &quot;Down In The Park&quot;, &quot;Skid Row&quot;) by John Karlgren\n\nReleased by Studio StÃƒÂ¶k, Ãƒâ€“rebro, Sweden\n\nSDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) by Sam Lantinga (http://www.libsdl.org)\nFMOD by Firelight Technologies Pty, Ltd.
