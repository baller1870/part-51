Fixes lip synch problems too automatically. Set it to output as MPEG and then drag that file into ConvertXToDVD (http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3721633) and you have a perfect DVD.\n\nwww.videoredo.com\n\n\nComplicated installation instructions? Sorry it&amp;#039;s nice and simple, no unzipping, unrarring, jumping through hoops or having to put a pineapple on your head. Just double click the file to install. Paste the name and key click REGISTER KEY. Restart the program and that&amp;#039;s it!\n\nBig thanks go out to Udo Engelhardt (whoever he/she is!) :p\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you&amp;#039;re updating this from an older version checkout these helpful tips from the older version (http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3664558) posted by Transient7:\n\n\nTransient7 at 2007-08-02 02:13 CET:\nSimply uninstalling does not remove all files/settings. If you&amp;#039;re like me, you want an application 100% removed, not leaving behind files. X(\n\nThis program writes all over the place, but I managed to remove the stored keys by observing it with Process Monitor.\n\nBelow is what I removed on my PC. Maybe this will work for you too, or maybe it&amp;#039;s different for different PC.\n\n1) uninstall VideoReDo\n2) load regedit\n3) remove HKey_Classes_RootCLSID{4FD11A18-7E4C-80CC-42B9-D836E268E95D}\n4) remove HKey_Local_MachineSoftwareLicenses\n5) remove HKEY_CLASSES_ROOTCLSID{3B394836-F59F-41C8-9E1C-590D0FB5BD70}\n6) remove HKEY_CLASSES_ROOTCLSID{890F1ED4-6E97-4FD7-98C6-1C2D0C4D6D25}\n7) remove HKEY_CLASSES_ROOTVideoReDo.Application\n8) remove HKEY_CLASSES_ROOTVideoReDo.VideoReDoSilent\n9) quit regedit\n10) delete all files in C:Documents and Settings(your username)Local SettingsTemp\n11) delete C:Documents and Settings(your username)Application DataVideoReDoPlus (maybe not there)\n\nThat should be it! Worked for me anyway...\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n...but if your old version works OK then don&amp;#039;t bother I&amp;#039;d say. Keep the newer one anyway for later ;-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53940022c7d81ed6da509e6aea809bb48a1f7b76","amp;dn":"VideoRedo+2.5.4.507+%28video+converter+%2B+fixes+lip+synch%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53940022c7d81ed6da509e6aea809bb48a1f7b76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,148,0,34,199,216,30,214,218,80,158,106,234,128,155,180,138,31,123,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
