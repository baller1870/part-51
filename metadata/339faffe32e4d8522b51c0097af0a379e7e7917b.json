After correctly predicting several deaths, he tells his friend Captain Riker what he is able to see, but the Captain doesn&amp;#039;t know whether to believe him or not. Riker consults with a doctor, Captain Gunther, who thinks it may be fatigue and suggests that the lieutenant should take a leave of rest. Fitzgerald goes to a hospital to see one of his men, Smitty, who is supposed to pull through. But he sees the strange light across the soldier&amp;#039;s face and knows his fate. Later, his prediction has come true, and he makes a scene in the hospital in front of Captain Gunther. Back at their tent, Fitz reveals to Riker he has seen the light on his face. Though he tells Fitz to forget it and get ready for battle, the Captain sets out some of his personal possessionsÃƒÂ¢??a few photographs and his wedding ringÃƒÂ¢??before he goes into combat. In the camp, the men argue about the rumors of the lieutenant&amp;#039;s predictions, but Riker tells all the soldiers there that there are no &quot;fortune tellers&quot; in the camp. Fitz, seeing the men&amp;#039;s faces and realizing he could cause mutiny, agrees with the captain. In the ensuing battle, all return except for Riker, who is killed by a sniper. Captain Gunther brings news to Fitzgerald that he is being sent back to division headquarters for some much needed rest, but as the lieutenant gathers his gear, he sees the light flash across his own face in a mirror. A jeep driver comes to pick Fitzgerald up for the ride to HQ, but the lieutenant seems distant, as if resigned to fate. The Sergeant sends the two off telling the driver to be careful as they go, they haven&amp;#039;t completely checked the area and watch for land mines on the road ahead. As the soldiers are gathered around the camp at dusk, the sound of an explosion is heard in the distance.\n\n\nMP4 Format for your IPOD\n\nPLEASE SEED! \n\nEnjoy! \n\nAntil0ck\n\n_______       ______________________      ______  \n___    |________  /___(_)__  /_  __ \\________  /__\n__  /| |_  __ \\  __/_  /__  /_  / / /  ___/_  //_/\n_  ___ |  / / / /_ _  / _  / / /_/ // /__ _  ,&lt;   \n/_/  |_/_/ /_/\\__/ /_/  /_/  \\____/ \\___/ /_/|_| ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:339faffe32e4d8522b51c0097af0a379e7e7917b","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+Episode+19-+The+Purple+testament","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"339faffe32e4d8522b51c0097af0a379e7e7917b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,159,175,254,50,228,216,82,43,81,192,9,122,240,163,121,231,231,145,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
