Sign the petition!\n    * 9-11 Research (5500)\n      9-11 Research focuses on the facts of the 9-11 attack and analysis of the official explanation.

We seek to provide a growing database of documents, links, media, and a variety of other sources related to the Movement, as well as a weekly podcast that encapsulates recent and major events in the 9/11 Truth Movement. In this way, we hope to be a sign post in the bustling and rapidly evolving 9/11 Truth Community.\n    * 911campusaction.blogspot.com/ (273)\n      9/11 Truth: Campus Action Network is a forum for students who are leading university or college 9/11 truth groups. We are interested in sharing ideas, resources and criticisms to help make our campaigns easier, less costly, more effective, and more fun. If you would like to join, contact adam.parrott at gmail.com\n    * 911Courage.org (472)\n      ESCALATE NOW!\n      Translate Courage into Power with Nonviolent Civil Disobedience.\n      Calling all 911Truth activists who want to make a real and lasting difference.\n      We can set a new record for the most states involved in a coordinated civil disobedience action on the same day.\n      THE MEDIA WILL HAVE TO COVER ITS SCALE AND CONTENT.\n    * 911EnvironmentalAction (195)\n      On television screens the world over, people watched the Twin Towers disintegrate into a fine dust which spread for miles. As the fires burned unabated, New York City residents began to realize that they and the many volunteers who had come to their aid had been exposed to an unprecedented mix of asbestos, fiberglass, lead, mercury, cadmium, dioxins, and hundreds of toxic substances that continue to endanger lives. School parents, residents, safety experts, environmentalists, labor unions, and religious and charitable organizations began to organize to protect themselves and each other, as it became all too obvious that government institutions were misleading or ignoring New Yorkers.\n\n      With the discovery that the federal government had the legal responsibility for investigation and clean up, 9/11 ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION was born. The EPA had abandoned us, hidden the data, and silenced their own ombudsman. We demand a comprehensive remediation of the environmental devastation of our beloved city. Our government must never again fail to take precautionary actions to protect the public health after an environmental disaster. Help in our campaign to make our land a safe place to live!\n    * 911Proof (6604)\n      Proof that 9/11 was an inside job. Excellent site for newcomers.\n    * 911revisited.com (922)\n      David Ray Griffin commented, &quot;Here&amp;#039;s new video, which probably provides the best case yet of this type for the controlled demolition of the WTC.&quot;\n\n      From the website: &quot;When I first set out to make this video it was only going to be so I could show my family &amp; friends the biggest question I have surrounding 9/11. Ever since I decided to upload it, I have been contacted by victims&amp;#039; families, firefighters &amp; police officers (that were there on 9/11), military, doctors, lawyers, engineers, professors, and others thanking me for making it.&quot;\n    * 911ShareTheTruth (3273)\n      Excellent site for educational and visibility resources: DVDs, books, posters, pins, stickers, etc.\n    * 911SpeakOut.org (122)\n      9/11 does not go away. It is with us on a daily basis. It is the emotional rationale for a long litany of radical changes in US policy:\n      * a supposed &quot;War on Terrorism&quot;\n      * actual wars in Iraq and Afghanistan\n      * possible future wars against a supposed &quot;axis of evil&quot;\n      * condoning torture and indefinite detention without any kind of due process\n      * scuttling the Geneva conventions\n      * the sacrifice of civil liberties at home\n\n      If 9/11 &quot;changed everything,&quot; as George W. Bush has said, then it is extremely important that we &quot;get it right.&quot; What really happened that day? The administration made a rush to judgment, immediately destroyed much of the evidence, stamped much of the remaining evidence &quot;Secret,&quot; and implied that critics were &quot;with the terrorists.&quot;\n\n      If all you know is what you have read in the papers or seen on the TV News, you are not fully informed, and you are quite possibly misinformed. We believe you have also been intentionally DIS-informed.\n    * CarolforCongress.org (699)\n      Official website of Carol Brouillet, Green candidate for California&amp;#039;s 14th Congressional District\n    * Center for Research on Globalization (2231)\n      Home of Global Outlook magazine.\n    * Citizens for Legitimate Government: 9/11 Exposition Zone (2920)\n      Long-running annotated archive of 9/11 oddities from one of the original skeptic sites.\n    * Colorado911.info (264)\n      The official narrative of 9/11 is based largely on coincidence &amp; conjecture, much of it based on key assumptions which remain untested.

Directed by Michael Berger\n      Director of Photography: John Gannon\n      Produced by Connect the Dots LLC\n    * Information Clearing House (123)\n      This website does not suggest that it contains the &quot;truth&quot;. The truth is a combination of all information and all facts relating to a topic. It is therefore unachievable (in my opinion) for anyone to say &quot;I know the truth.&quot;\n\n      If you came to this site in search of &quot;the truth&quot; you will be disappointed. That is also true of CNN, FOX , ABC etc. If you came to gather information you may find it a useful resource.\n\n      Gibran says in the &quot;Prophet&quot; Say not, &quot;I have found the truth,&quot; but rather, &quot;I have found a truth.&quot;\n\n      That brings me to my first point:\n\n      John Adams said &quot;Liberty can not be preserved without general knowledge among people&quot; this statement points to the absolute necessity of an informed citizenry if our nation is to remain a functioning free society.\n\n      This means that each citizen has a civic responsibility to inform himself and share that information with others. The corporate media pumps information into our homes and does a great job of providing the information that our government wants us to know. It has in my opinion become the propaganda arm of government, and a great number of those who call themselves journalists are in fact nothing less than presstitutes.\n\n      Those who wish to inhibit free access to information are in my opinion a great danger to our nation. Why would any adult interfere with the right of fellow citizens to inform themselves?\n\n      There is a war going on for the minds of America, those waging this war are determined to control the American people by taking possession of our minds and by controlling our sources of information.\n\n      Truth is indefinable.

We felt it our duty as patriots to create a web-based independent media outlet where we can not only debunk the myth of the liberal media but expose the corruption and cronyism taking place at the highest levels of government and corporate power.\n\n      The Project for the Old American Century conducts its own research and compiles dossiers made available to the public both via the web or in print free of charge. Topics include conflicts of interest inside government agencies, specific profiles of top public officials, data acquired through the Freedom of Information Act, and much more.\n    * rat haus reality: Crimes Against Humanity (1172)\n      The 9-11 bombings Are Not Acts of War - The 9-11 bombings Are Crimes Against Humanity\n    * Rawstory.com (39)\n\n      Our mission:\n      The Raw Story is an alternative news nexus.

We realized that all of us are generally invested in discovering important facts, under-reported by mainstream journalists, and presenting them to the public. The environment, the war, surveillance, election fraud, media complicity. social control. There is a rational crossroads between all these concerns where we find that what really matters is that the public learn to care about the fact that they don&amp;#039;t know the truth. Motivated by that concern, TruthMove will remind everyone that getting people to think for themselves is more imporant than telling them what to think. As much as we are focused on a popular, accessible approach, making the website a curriculum of sorts, we also hope to remind progressive intellectuals what they all have in common.
