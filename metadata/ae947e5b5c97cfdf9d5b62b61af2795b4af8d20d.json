The sound is generally more intelligible here, and the picture may be more appealing. Also, it should transfer in about 1/7 the time.\nStill, the sound is not always understandable and has a room echo due to the poor pickup. The picture is at best shaky. Commercial TV quality it&amp;#039;s not. If you can get better sound AND/OR picture for this speech, please post it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae947e5b5c97cfdf9d5b62b61af2795b4af8d20d","amp;dn":"Ron+Paul+Iowa+speech+2007-06-30","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae947e5b5c97cfdf9d5b62b61af2795b4af8d20d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,148,126,91,92,151,207,223,157,91,98,182,26,242,121,91,74,248,210,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
