Ripped .: \n\nnuthing...its complete!\n\n\n\n:. About .:\n\nEvery self-respecting fantasy game has dragons, and nine times \nout of ten it&amp;#039;s your job to slay the evil things.\n\nBut Drakan: Order of the Flame is one of those rarer occasions \nwhen the dragon actually does your bidding. Drakan first comes \nacross as a third-person action game like any other in the quickly \nburgeoning genre, but you&amp;#039;ll know this game is onto something \nearly on, when lanky redheaded heroine Rynn releases the kindly \nold dragon Arokh and takes to the skies on his back. Add great \ngraphics, mean monsters, deadly traps, and huge areas to explore \nboth from the sky and on foot, and you&amp;#039;ll see that Drakan is clearly \none of the better games in its class, even if it doesn&amp;#039;t seem especially\noriginal. After all, Rynn&amp;#039;s just a medieval Lara Croft riding on your \naverage dragon. You won&amp;#039;t remember Drakan for its characters, \nbut you&amp;#039;ll have fun playing it...\n\nIf the world of Drakan weren&amp;#039;t filled with ill-tempered eight-foot tall pig men,\nacid-spitting bird-beasts, and evil spirits, it would make a beautiful vacation \nspot. \nRynn&amp;#039;s adventures will take her from snowy mountains to tropical islands\nand from ancient catacombs to dormant volcanoes. All these settings are \ncolorful and vividly detailed with realistic weather and lighting effects, and \nvisibility remains high except when you soar way up to see mountains suddenly \nappear on the horizon \nas you fly by. Though most of them are your typical sword-and-sorcery fodder,\nthe denizens that sully these otherwise attractive locations are distinctively \ndesigned, from the menacing but oafish trolls to the predictably seductive yet \nvaguely reptilian succubi. \nRynn can literally hack them all to bits with a huge variety of mundane and \nmagical medieval weapons, though the greatest difference among most of \nthese is their appearance.\n\n\n:. screenshots .:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/drakanorderoftheflame/images.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gsimage&amp;tag=images;all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/drakanorderoftheflame/images.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gsimage&amp;tag=images;all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n:.
