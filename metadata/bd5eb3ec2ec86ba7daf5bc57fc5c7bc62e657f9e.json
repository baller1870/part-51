We are aware that the above speaks only to geeks.\n\nIDA Pro is a disassembler.\nAs a disassembler, IDA Pro explores binary programs, for which source code isn&amp;#039;t always available,\nto create maps of their execution. The real interest of a disassembler is that it shows the instructions that are\nactually executed by the processor in a symbolic representation called assembly language. If the friendly\nscreen saver you have just installed is spying on your e-banking session or logging your e-mails, a\ndisassembler can reveal it. However, assembly language is hard to make sense of. That&amp;#039;s why advanced\ntechniques have been implemented into IDA Pro to make that code more readable, in some cases, quite close\nto the original source code that produced the binary program. The map of the program&amp;#039;s code then be postprocessed\nfor further investigations. Some people have used it as the root of a genomic classification of\nviruses. (digital genome mapping ? advanced malware analysis)\n\nIDA Pro is a debugger.\nBut, in real life, things aren&amp;#039;t always simple. Hostile code usually does not cooperate with the\nanalyst. Viruses, worms and trojans are often armoured and obfuscated. More powerful tools are required.\nThe debugger in IDA Pro complements the static analysis capabilities of the disassembler: by allowing to\nsingle step through the code being investigated, the debugger often bypasses the obfuscation and helps obtain\ndata that the more powerful static disassembler will be able to process in depth. IDA Pro can be used as a\nlocal and as a remote debugger on the 80x86 (typically Windows/Linux) and the ARM plaform (typically\nWindows CE PDAs). Remote debuggers are very useful when one wants to safely dissect potentially harmful\nprograms.\n\nIDA Pro is interactive.\nBecause no computer can currently beat the human brain when it comes to exploring the unknown,\nIDA Pro is fully interactive. In sharp contrast with its predecessors, IDA always allows the human analyst to\noverride its decisions or to provide hints. Interactivity culminates in a built-in programming language and an\nopen plugin architecture.\n\nIDA Pro is programmable\nIDA Pro contains a complete development environment that consists of a very powerful macro-like\nlanguage that can be used to automate simple to medium complexity tasks. For more advanced tasks, our\nopen plugin architecture puts no limits on what external developers can do to enhance IDA Pro&amp;#039;s\nfunctionality. One could, for example, extend IDA Pro with a MP3 player and make malware sing. However,\nwe suspect our governmental customers are involved in more serious projects.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd5eb3ec2ec86ba7daf5bc57fc5c7bc62e657f9e","amp;dn":"ida_pro_5.0.0.879_advanced_full_wWw.CRACKLAB.rU.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd5eb3ec2ec86ba7daf5bc57fc5c7bc62e657f9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,94,179,236,46,200,107,167,218,245,188,87,252,92,123,198,46,101,127,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
