But Claudin loses both his touch and his job, murders a rascally music publisher in a fit of madness, and has his face etched with acid. Soon, mysterious crimes plague the Paris Opera House, blamed on a legendary &quot;phantom&quot; whom none can find in the mazes and catacombs. But both of Christine&amp;#039;s lovers have plans to ferret him out.\n\nAUDIO (CODEC): 2.0 Mono\n\nFORMAT (PAL O NTSC): Pal\n\nIDIOMA: Spanish, English, Italian.\n\nSUBTITLES: InglÃƒÂ©s, EspaÃƒÂ±ol, PortuguÃƒÂ©s, Italiano, Croata, Polaco, Serbio, Esloveno..\n\nIMAGE: 1.33:1, 4:3 B/N\n\nEXTRAS:Interactive menus, Direct acces to escenes, The unmasked ghost: documentary original, commentary of the cinema historian Scott MacQueen, new remasterized track of audio for the maximum quality, photographies of production, trailer of cinema.\n\nFORMAT: DVD9 =&gt; DVD5\n\nCOMPRESSION: DVD Rebuilder + CCE\n\nRIPPED BY SODAPOP\n\nCovers Included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ebc0820074b124d49bee35b2cd53dd2f4016adf","amp;dn":"CYCLE+MONSTER+LEGACY+-+Phantom+Of+The+Opera+%281943%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ebc0820074b124d49bee35b2cd53dd2f4016adf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,188,8,32,7,75,18,77,73,190,227,91,44,213,61,210,244,1,106,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
