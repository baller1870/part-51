Or trying to save a broken system and only ever burned linux to CD-R discs? Well if youve got an iPod (im using a nano 2G), your usb cable and a computer your in luck install the winimage .exe file and then open the app that installs. Now open the ubuntu 7.04 .iso image and go to the image panel and select extract and then extract with pathname go to browse and select the drive name for the iPod. Hit ok and sit back (this should take at least 2-4 minutes)Now reboot your computer and select to boot from the iPod. This should work, althought i can tell you that i have not tried this i created this torrent on a computer that does not support booting from an external flash memory usb device. This will not brick your iPod. IMPORTANT you should format your iPod before doing this!!! If you did it correctly (I think) Your iPod should say Please Restore via iTunes when you turn it on. I cannot garuntee this will work but it most likely will thank you for downloading.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7f37005927b41ca9e773d439c8b93eeb37b2c2b","amp;dn":"Boot+Ubuntu+From+iPod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7f37005927b41ca9e773d439c8b93eeb37b2c2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,243,112,5,146,123,65,202,158,119,61,67,156,139,147,238,179,123,44,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
