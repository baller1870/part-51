Furthermore it plays no role in providing power for transport. So its overall contribution to total UK energy demand is small - only 3.6%.\n\nSo even replacing our existing fleet of nuclear reactors over the coming decades will still leave us needing significant amounts of energy from other sources. The only sustainable solution to climate change and energy security is to reform the centralised UK energy system. \n\nCurrently, two thirds of the energy from power stations in the UK is lost as wasted heat up the chimneys and down the power lines because it is produced a long way from where it is required. We need to generate power close to where it is needed, allowing us to use both the heat for central heating and hot water, and the electricity for our other needs. This is known as a decentralised energy system. We also need a massive uptake of energy efficiency and renewable energy. \n\nSounds revolutionary? Other countries in Europe already generate power locally and use renewable technologies as well. The result is cleaner, cheaper, more efficient energy than nuclear power - better for the environment and for all of us. \n\nTaken from the Greenpeace UK Website.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.greenpeace.org.uk/contentlookup.cfm?SitekeyParam=D-E&amp;CFID=5852076&amp;CFTOKEN=59475751&amp;MenuPoint=D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.greenpeace.org.uk/contentlookup.cfm?SitekeyParam=D-E&amp;CFID=5852076&amp;CFTOKEN=59475751&amp;MenuPoint=D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFile Type : MP4 [ISO 14496-14:2003]\nSize: 49.6Mb\n\nMime : video/mp4\nLength : 17m 59sec\nkbps:385\nQf:0.037\nCodec: MPEG-4 AAC LC\n24000Hz [2 chnls]\nPicture 720 x 576\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bdb4a94d4453328f63f3de2fce093cb82dc231d","amp;dn":"Greenpeace+Decentralised+Energy.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bdb4a94d4453328f63f3de2fce093cb82dc231d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,219,74,148,212,69,51,40,246,63,61,226,252,224,147,203,130,220,35,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
