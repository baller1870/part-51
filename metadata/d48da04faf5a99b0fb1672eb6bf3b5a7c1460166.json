Part 1 of 4\n\nThe earth is on the verge of disaster, and it\\&amp;#039;s happening in this very moment. In this moment we are sitting in our luxuary western world just seeing it happen. \n\nSee this, and do something about it. \n\nWhat you are able to do in your daily life is a lot. \n\n* Don\\&amp;#039;t buy bottle water, take from the tap (for every 1.5 litre you drink it\\&amp;#039;s equal drinking a small cap of oil. \n\n* Take the Bus\n\n* Take a shower rather than a bath, and take a short shower. \n\n* Buy ecological food.\n\n* Become a vegetarian, (in every food step, 90 % of the energy is lost ie. 10 kg grass is only 1 kg Cow. )\n\n* Fly less, take the train instead. \n\nThere is a lot to do. By all means complete the list. \nAnd if there is somewhere out there that would like to sub this to english entirely. Please do so. I don\\&amp;#039;t have the skill to do it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d48da04faf5a99b0fb1672eb6bf3b5a7c1460166","amp;dn":"The+Planet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d48da04faf5a99b0fb1672eb6bf3b5a7c1460166","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,141,160,79,175,90,153,176,251,22,114,235,107,243,181,167,193,70,1,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
