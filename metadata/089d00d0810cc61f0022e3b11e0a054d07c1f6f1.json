Several of the  missions \n          in this game are based on actual missions at the time,\n          and several are purely fictitious. While we have made \n          no attempt to achieve strict historical accuracy,  we \n          have made every attempt to acknowledge the courageous \n          Servicemen that comprised Task Force Ranger  and  the \n          American contingent of  Operation  Restore  Hope. The \n          Soldiers of Task Force Ranger and the  10th  Mountain \n          Division, who fought valiantly on the 3rd and 4th  of \n          October,  1993,  engaged  in  the  U.S.  Army?s  most \n          intense Infantry fight since the war in Vietnam.\n          These brave men deserve a tribute, and to the  extent \n          that we can do that with a video game, we salute them.\n          The objectives set forth for the mission on  the  3rd \n          of October, namely to capture two of Mohammed Aidid?s \n          lieutenants, were successfully accomplished. The  two \n          lieutenants, plus twenty-two of their comrades,  were \n          quickly captured. However, during the course  of  the \n          operation, two Black Hawk helicopters were shot  down \n          in enemy territory.  Eighteen  Americans  lost  their \n          lives, either in the crashes, or fighting  to  defend  \n          them, in the seventeen hour  battle  that  ensued. In \n          the immediate aftermath of  the  fight,  the  reports \n          were overwhelmingly negative, describing  the  battle \n          as a  failed   mission, a  bungled  operation,  or  a \n          disaster. We respectfully disagree; we think that the \n          men  of  Task  Force  Ranger  and  the 10th  Mountain \n          Division fought in  the  finest traditions of the U.S. \n          military, and accomplished what they set  out  to  do \n          that day.  While  the  downed  helicopters  certainly \n          changed the plan, the Americans who fought  that  day \n          did so with the highest degree  of  courage,  resolve, \n          and resourcefulness,  and  virtually  eliminated  the \n          Habir Gedr militia. We offer this game  in  the  hope \n          that, as you use it, you reflect on the sacrifices of \n          these men and their families, sacrifices  that  allow \n          the rest of us to enjoy products like this one in the \n          safety and comfort of our homes.  And  as  we  do  so, \n          these men and those to  whom  they  have  passed  the \n          torch, quietly continue the fight.\n\n         Use one of the following serials:\n         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n          8NRC-WEMR-7MX7-Q6AZ-5KAL\n          87HJ-AIFM-AMAO-PFCR-SMSQ\n          QKMT-LYAB-HIWB-ZMNW-FYPV\n          QTZ3-RHZT-P5TB-LQXH-7JD3\n          QFSH-LKOP-KFTT-UJYD-JORR\n          87HJ-AIFM-AMAO-PFCR-SMSQ\n          873F-BSYZ-EWIH-XVMB-SZEJ\n          QDGF-NTGC-QNLK-WJTV-VTPK\n          8MLM-JYTR-FIOY-KBLG-BIPD\n          QNBF-XKLY-ZFDN-ZKVU-UBYR\n\nFiles  : tlOd-dfbdh.r00\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r01\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r02\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r03\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r04\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r05\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r06\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r07\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r08\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r09\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r10\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r11\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r12\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r13\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r14\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r15\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r16\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r17\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r18\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r19\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r20\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r21\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r22\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r23\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r24\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r25\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r26\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r27\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r28\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r29\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r30\n         tlOd-dfbdh.r31\n         tlOd-dfbdh.rar\n\nSize   : 33x15 MB {467,00 MB}\n\n===============================================================\n\nName   : Delta Force: Black Hawk Down - Team Sabre\nFormat : .rar\nCrack  : Yes, it is in folder \\&quot;Crack\\&quot;\nInfo   : As the US army\\&amp;#039;s elite special operations soldiers you \n          are the most potent \\&amp;#039;smart weapon\\&amp;#039; known to man.
