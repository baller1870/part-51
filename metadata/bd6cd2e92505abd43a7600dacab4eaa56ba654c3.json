I decided it would be nice to have some sort of compilation of &amp;#039;music videos&amp;#039; by the Beatles on a DVD disc set (which to my knowledge, other than the blue and red VCD set, does not exist), seeing as they were the one of the first (if not the first) bands to do &amp;#039;em. I have not done this project as an effort to piss off or belittle the work of Apple corps. or any other company dedicated to continuing the commercial success of this great band.\n\nHOW\n\nI first extracted and gathered all the clips I would add to the DVD project; they would be gathered from the original 64 music video torrent, the anthology and finally, the movies. Most of the clips from the 64 vid torrent were in bad shape (in most cases taped from a VHS source) and I decided to use unified VCD sources, instead of mixing it with the worst quality VHS clips and higher quality DVDs. Some of the clips had poor audio quality or narrative stuck in between frames, so I had to improvise on quite a few clips (messing around with sound and cutting/pasting stuff). \n\nWHY\n\nI am not a hardcore video editor, I just did this to have fun, to practice editing (me being a filmmaker) and to have something to share with other Beatles fans (see if you can spot the parts where I tried to blend in sound to hide narrative and such). I used Sony Vegas 6.0 to edit the whole thing together, VCDgear to extract mpegs from bin files and MPEG Splitter to cut clips from those mpegs.\n\nTHANKS\n\ngreenyellowbook (eBay picture)\nstevesbeatles.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd6cd2e92505abd43a7600dacab4eaa56ba654c3","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+DVD+Vol.+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd6cd2e92505abd43a7600dacab4eaa56ba654c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,108,210,233,37,5,171,212,58,118,0,218,202,180,234,165,107,166,84,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
