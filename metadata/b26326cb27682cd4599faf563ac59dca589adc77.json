Produced for the Sundance Channel and Court TV, the short-film collection is an engaging exploration of recent free speech battles (and yes, a few bad words do get spoken). The best known participants include documentary filmmaker Chris Hegedus (The War Room) and actor/director Mario Van Peebles (Baadasssss!), but all three films take a similar approach. Hegedus and Nick Doob (American High) are behind Fox vs. Franken, which looks at the suit filed against author Al Franken for using the phrase &quot;fair and balanced&quot; in the subtitle to his book Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them. Van Peebles&amp;#039; Poetic License focuses on the furor over former New Jersey Poet Laureate Amiri Baraka&amp;#039;s &quot;Somebody Blew Up America,&quot; while John Walter (How to Draw a Bunny), in Some Assembly Required, trains his lens on the protests surrounding 2004&amp;#039;s Republican National Convention.\n\n\nAmiri Baraka Statement.pdf\nFox News Side of the story.pdf\nFox vs Franken.pdf\nIf Fox News had won.pdf\nPress Stress.pdf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b26326cb27682cd4599faf563ac59dca589adc77","amp;dn":"The+First+Amendment+Project-+PDFs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b26326cb27682cd4599faf563ac59dca589adc77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,99,38,203,39,104,44,212,89,159,175,86,58,197,157,202,88,154,220,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
