It was quite a life (and time) saver. I&amp;#039;m not sure how I could have gotten through it all without the help of these programs. Included is everything you could possibly need as a student or practitioner within the medical field. There&amp;#039;s about 100 or so Skyscape programs, about 40 eBooks, and a few other random medical programs that might come in helpful. Installation instructions and codez all included. Although much of this is several years out of date as far as publication date is concerned, most of it is still quite relevant as far as factual knowledge. This is a great starter pack for any one in the medical field who owns or is thinking about purchasing a Palm Pilot. I hope this helps others as much as it helped me...
