It is perfectly suited for professional and semi-professional content creators with projects such as:\n\nProfessional content production\n\nThroughout the professional content production process, many approvals and progress checks are necessary. With QuickTime Player and the QuickTime MPEG-2 Playback Component, your clients and reviewers can view your MPEG-2 streams and provide feedback. This eliminates the need for frequent transcodes and allows your clients and reviewers to play back your work on any Macintosh or PC.\n\nTranscoding video content\n\nYour MPEG-2 video content can be imported into QuickTime and exported to other formats such as MPEG-4, the new international standard for Internet media, QuickTime Movie or DV Stream, to name a few. The QuickTime MPEG-2 Playback Component allows the transcode of MPEG-2 video from both multiplexed and elementary video streams(1). By converting your MPEG-2 video content into other formats, it can be used in new forums, such as on the web, on CD-ROM or on DV tape.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74fb19755a4d1e08388b5b0e6dc038e42c62c741","amp;dn":"WinQuickTimeMPEG2.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74fb19755a4d1e08388b5b0e6dc038e42c62c741","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,251,25,117,90,77,30,8,56,139,91,14,109,192,56,228,44,98,199,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
