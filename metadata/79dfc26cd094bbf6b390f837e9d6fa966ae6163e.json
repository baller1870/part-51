Recorded in 2003 at McMaster University.\n\n\nA few hours after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon, the Bush administration concluded without supporting evidence, that &quot;Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaeda organisation were prime suspects&quot;. CIA Director George Tenet stated that bin Laden has the capacity to plan ``multiple attacks with little or no warning.&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Secretary of State Colin Powell called the attacks &quot;an act of war&quot; and President Bush confirmed in an evening televised address to the Nation that he would &quot;make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them&quot;. Former CIA Director James Woolsey pointed his finger at &quot;state sponsorship,&quot; implying the complicity of one or more foreign governments. In the words of former National Security Adviser, Lawrence Eagleburger, &quot;I think we will show when we get attacked like this, we are terrible in our strength and in our retribution.&quot;\n\nMeanwhile, parroting official statements, the Western media mantra has approved the launching of &quot;punitive actions&quot; directed against civilian targets in the Middle East. In the words of William Saffire writing in the New York Times: &quot;When we reasonably determine our attackers&amp;#039; bases and camps, we must pulverize them -- minimizing but accepting the risk of collateral damage&quot; -- and act overtly or covertly to destabilize terror&amp;#039;s national hosts&quot;.\n\n\nRunning Time: 1 hr 56 min\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information on September 11th, NWO and the great threat to you can be found at www.infowars.com or www.prisonplanet.tv\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79dfc26cd094bbf6b390f837e9d6fa966ae6163e","amp;dn":"War+and+Globalization+-+The+Truth+Behind+Sept+11+%5BDVD%2FNTSC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79dfc26cd094bbf6b390f837e9d6fa966ae6163e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,223,194,108,208,148,187,246,179,144,248,55,233,214,250,150,106,230,22,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
