Lame mofo attitude! Also, when I lost my disc to my IxusV2, that gave me some problems. Perhaps I can help someone out there with this.\nSo I present to you the latest (I hope) disc that came with my Ixus850IS (actually IXY900IS, as it is called in Korea).\n\nNote: My ISP is f*cked up, so I only have 0,5MB up for now, please bear with me. Even if I go offline, I will go back up and seed within 12hrs. I am superseeding.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f73ed58d93610f5533beb7b2e9d427e1e892ac8","amp;dn":"Canon+Digital+camera+solution+disk+v29.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f73ed58d93610f5533beb7b2e9d427e1e892ac8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,115,237,88,217,54,16,245,83,59,235,123,46,157,66,126,30,137,42,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
