They gave her &quot;The Bullshit Award&quot; \nfor sustaining poverty. TIME says she is a hero of our times, an icon for \nyoungsters all over the world. \n\nThe film is about Vandana Shiva, Indian environmental activist and nuclear \nphysicist, who was awarded the Right Livelihood Award in 1993. It&amp;#039;s a film on \nglobalisation and patenting, on genetic engineering, bio-piracy, indigenous \nknowledge. \n\nIn this documentary, the filmmakers follow Vandana Shiva over a two-year period, \nfrom her organic farm at the foot of the Himalayas to institutions of power all \nover the world. Here Vandana Shiva does battle with one of her toughest \nopponents, Monsanto, a huge American biotech company, when they try to patent an \nancient Indian strain of wheat. Together with Dalits she tries to close down a \nCoca-Cola plant in Kerala, in a conflict involving groundwater pollution. In \nthis film Vandana Shiva also tackles the question of farmer&amp;#039;s suicide, a \nbacklash of the globalisation. \n\nThe filmmakers describe Monsanto from the inside and arrange what proves a \nshaking meeting between Vandana Shiva and Barun Mitra, liberal think-tank, \nlobbyist and fierce critic of Vandana Shiva ÃƒÂ» and the man who gave her the &quot;Bullshit Prize&quot;. \n\n\nPeÃƒâ€¦ Holmquist and Suzanne Khardalian are Swedish independent filmmakers who have \ndirected more than 50 documentaries, among them several award-winning films, \nlike Gaza Ghetto, Back to Ararat, Unsafe Ground, Her Armenian Prince, From Opium \nto Chrysanthemums, My Dad the Inspector and I Hate Dogs ÃƒÂ» the last survivor. \n\nOn the film: \n\nBULLSHIT shows us another side of the Third World... Like a small hot, colourful \nsteam engine, she puffs along, the Indian environment activist Vandana Shiva... \nPeople, in what we in the West call the Third World, are all too often shown as \nvictims ÃƒÂ» an image that Vandana Shiva does away with entirely.\nSvenska Dagbladet, major Swedish daily paper\n\nIf you need cheering up, you should link Darwin&amp;#039;s Nightmare to PeÃƒâ€¦ Holmquist \nand Suzanne Khardalian&amp;#039;s &quot;Bullshit&quot;, which describes Indian Vandana Shiva&amp;#039;s \nstruggle ÃƒÂ» filling all with enthusiasm  against as yet unproven-to-be-safe gene \nmanipulation and against major companies&amp;#039; continual attempts to patent all \nmanner of crops in order to take over the world market, something that would \nresult in disaster.\nDagens Nyheter, major Swedish daily paper\n\nBULLSHIT is a fantastic and inspiring film. Vandana Shiva deserves the Nobel \nPrize, but people like her, and Noam Chomsky who I made a film about a few years \nago, are always overlooked.\nPeter Wintonick, Canadian filmmaker\n\nMore related stuff: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/BhangWalla&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/BhangWalla&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc1db0b9f15396bda15f559d8a1d4ff5718a059a","amp;dn":"Bullshit+%282005%29+PAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc1db0b9f15396bda15f559d8a1d4ff5718a059a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,29,176,185,241,83,150,189,161,95,85,157,138,29,79,245,113,138,5,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
