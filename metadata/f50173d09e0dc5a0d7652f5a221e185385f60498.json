In addition, an original modeling approach to arriving at energy and amino acid needs for given animals is incorporated in this revision.&quot; \n\n&quot;Nutrient Requirements of Swine covers:\nBiological concepts that underlie nutrient needs for growth and function. New data on amino acid and energy requirements and the factors that shape them. New findings on lysine and the bioavailability of amino acids. New research results on minerals and vitamins. Nutrient composition of an expanded list of feedstuffs. The role of water in swine physiology, including factors that affect the quality of drinking water. Expanded tables of feed ingredients and their nutrient composition provide bioavailability estimates, fatty acid composition of fats typically used in swine diets, and important information on estimating the amino acid content of crude protein.&quot;\n\n\n\nThis torrent has just the book (pdf), I couldn&amp;#039;t find the computer program, that is, I found it, but I couldn&amp;#039;t make it work... I don&amp;#039;t know if there&amp;#039;s something wrong about the file itself or if it&amp;#039;s something in my computer. (anyway, you can download it at http://newton.nap.edu/html/swinemodel/ ).\n\n\nYou can know more about the book in: http://newton.nap.edu/catalog/6016.html\n\n\nIf anyone by chance has the program, please share :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f50173d09e0dc5a0d7652f5a221e185385f60498","amp;dn":"Nutrient+Requirements+of+Swine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f50173d09e0dc5a0d7652f5a221e185385f60498","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,1,115,208,158,13,197,160,215,101,47,90,34,30,24,83,133,246,4,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
