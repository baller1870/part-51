It was a sad day for Swiss history when the airline\\\\\\&amp;#039;s fleet was grounded on 2 October 2001. \\\\\\&quot;Grounding\\\\\\&quot; is set during the last days of the doomed airline, and tells the story of manager Mario A. Corti\\\\\\&amp;#039;s unhappy fate, the last, unlucky CEO at the traditional airline company, as well as of all those nameless people who lost almost everything in the maelstrom of Swissair\\\\\\&amp;#039;s downfall: their job, home and their belief in Switzerland.\n\nCreated from the original DVD using dvdshrink. Swiss-German audio, German, French and Itialian subtitles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8503cab67d396c128b7880c3de9103ed6b290b21","amp;dn":"Grounding%3A+The+Last+Days+of+Swissair","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8503cab67d396c128b7880c3de9103ed6b290b21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,3,202,182,125,57,108,18,139,120,128,195,222,145,3,237,107,41,11,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
