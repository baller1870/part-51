Lo, the witness, has photographic evidence of Mead gunning down a police man on the orders of Manila crime boss Cardoza. Edward, too, has a personal interest in the case. The murdered man was his father. Richard Lo is assassinated while they are en route to the airport. \n\nLo&amp;#039;s girlfriend, Jenny (Lily Lee), works at a local nightclub. Frend&amp;#039;s enquiries there lead to a ferocious fistfight, an event which exacerbates the conflict between the Hong Kong cop and his local counterpart. Edward and his young partner Billy (Joel Terre) come to both like and respect this unconventional Chinese lawman. Gabriel (Gabriel Romulo) engages Billy in a lethal game of one-on-one, a match that ends with an exploding basketball and Billy&amp;#039;s death... \n\nCast: Donnie Yen Ji-Dan  ||  Roy Cheung Yiu-Yeung  ||  Lily Lee (Lee Lee)  ||  Ngaai Diy  ||  Man Sin Liu  ||  Lai Chi Saan  ||  Frankie Chan (Chi Leung)  ||  Mandy Chan  ||  Edu Manzano  ||  Joel Terre  ||  Gabriel Romulo  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.538138/qx/details.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.538138/qx/details.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nP.S.\nSubtitles file for &quot;New Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; available at:\n\n_________________\nDo not break the share chain!
