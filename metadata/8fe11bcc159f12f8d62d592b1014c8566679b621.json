This was ripped in EAC and encoded in Lame -aps.\n\nCarlos Giffoni: computer, synth, guitar\nLee Ranaldo: guitar, firebell\nJim O&amp;#039;Rourke: synth\n\nRecorded 31 August, 2003, North Six, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY\nRecorded by Bob Teagan (room) and Dave Curran (soundboard)\nFOH mix by Dave Curran\nEdited/mixed by LR @ Eho Canyon NYC, assisted by Aaron Mullan\nMastered by Tim Barnes at Quakebasket\nPhotography: LIsbon #80 (2003) by LR\n\nInfo:\n\n A seething, screaming set of power electronics and guitar with hardly a moment&amp;#039;s pause for air, this recording finds the trio of Carlos Giffoni (computer, synth, guitar), Lee Ranaldo (guitar, firebell) and Jim O&amp;#039;Rourke (synth) in devastating form. This is classic free bombast, alternately sounding like a &quot;rock band&quot; interpretation of Merzbow&amp;#039;s Rainbow Electronics or a punk update of a Musica Elettronica Viva session. The instantly identifiable Ranaldo/Sonic Youth guitar sound is joined by blurting digital scree and analog filter abuse, melding to create a heavy tidal rush of ecstatic cosmic noise. The bliss of the set is confirmed by the Brooklyn audience&amp;#039;s joyful reaction at the close.\n\n    &quot;North Six is a mind-bogglingly great trio recording from two adepts and an up-and-coming interventionist. Definitively old-school noise in inclination, the performers repeatedly set bombs and deviant devices of their own making against each other, stoking a great astral spat. A wild plume of electric-fire smoke invades the performance space as Ranaldo&amp;#039;s guitar is repeatedly speared by silver darts of electronics. This tactic only serves to illuminate those moments where the six-string suddenly soars out of the thick air and propels the improvisation far into the stratosphere, Giffoni and O&amp;#039;Rourke&amp;#039;s duelling synths sparking like stars communing in abstract constellations.&quot;\n    - Jon Dale, Stylus Magazine, July 2004\n\n    &quot;Ranaldo&amp;#039;s electric guitar strafes and scorches, a snarling onslaught of clangs and feedback screeches. Giffoni plays guitar and computer, and he and O&amp;#039;Rourke use synthesizers like mean action painters, splurging, dripping and recklessly splashing the sounds around.&quot;\n    - Julian Cowley, The Wire, #248\n\n    &quot;...fissions those blissful feedback codas of Lee Ranaldo and Jim O&amp;#039;Rourke&amp;#039;s full-time outfit into their rawest atoms.&quot;\n    - Joe Panzner, Grooves 015\n\n    &quot;...like being slapped by violent rain while riding a bike.&quot;\n    - Massimo Ricci, Touching Extremes, August 2004\n\n    &quot;If ever there was a lo-fi punk version of musique concrete, then it must be this trio... Essential listening for those who love noise...&quot;\n    - Frans de Waard, Vital Weekly #430","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fe11bcc159f12f8d62d592b1014c8566679b621","amp;dn":"Carlos+Giffoni+%2F+Lee+Ranaldo+%2F+Jim+O%5C%27Rourke+-+North+Six","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fe11bcc159f12f8d62d592b1014c8566679b621","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,225,27,204,21,159,18,248,214,45,89,43,16,20,200,86,102,121,182,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
