Some have noted an issue with GZ files stored on a windows file system hard drive, as having strange effects? Not least defragmentation being severely handicapped. The ISO image format solves these adverse effects that may otherwise occur.\n\nHow to use: either burn them to disk for mounting through your DVD drive or by use of ISO mounting software such as Nero Image Drive. Point your Flight Gear scenery application path to the mounted DVD and run from there.\n\nThe application file itself is quite small, the bulk of the size is taken up by the whole world scenery or terrain being a more appropriate term, well the world might have been created in 6 days by god, but it takes a very long time to build the whole world including buildings and Bridges etc, so dont expect to much as the scenery is constantly being improved, http://fgfsdb.stockill.org/\n\nScreen shots: http://fgfsdb.stockill.org/modelbrowser.php\n\nFull instructions on how to configure the FLIGHTGEAR simulator is available on the main website. http://wiki.flightgear.org/flightgear_wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d3f2619501cd72941e12ba4914ac64ea9b6a5bb","amp;dn":"FlightGear_4X_Scenery_DVD_Multi_Disk-set","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d3f2619501cd72941e12ba4914ac64ea9b6a5bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,63,38,25,80,28,215,41,65,225,43,164,145,74,198,78,169,182,165,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
