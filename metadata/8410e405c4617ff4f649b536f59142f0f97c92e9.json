The trees may be small but filming from the air reveals its true scale. A third of all trees on Earth grow here and during the short summer they produce enough oxygen to change the atmosphere.\n\nIn California General Sherman, a giant sequoia, is the largest living thing on the planet, ten times the size of a blue whale. The oldest organisms alive are bristlecone pines. At more than 4,000 years old they pre-date the pyramids. But the baobab forests of Madagascar are perhaps the strangest of all. \n\n\nEpisode 11: Ocean Deep\n\nLife goes to extraordinary lengths to survive this immense realm. A 30 tonne whale shark gorges on a school of fish and the unique overhead heli-gimbal camera reveals common dolphins rocketing at more than 30km an hour.\n\nDescending into the abyss, deep sea octopus fly with wings and vampire squid use bioluminescence to create an extraordinary colour display. The first ever time-lapse footage taken from 2,000m down captures eels, crabs and giant isopods eating a carcass, completely consuming it within three hours.\n\n\nEpisode 12: Credits\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8410e405c4617ff4f649b536f59142f0f97c92e9","amp;dn":"Planet+Earth+Disc+4-OnlyMe1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8410e405c4617ff4f649b536f59142f0f97c92e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,16,228,5,196,97,127,244,246,73,181,54,245,145,66,240,249,124,146,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
