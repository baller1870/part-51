However, the IT infrastructure has many potential weak spots: sensitive information stored on servers and personal devices demand around-the-clock protection, and system availability is a prerequisite for business continuity.\n\nTherefore, unauthorized access to the IT infrastructure is a major concern. Security issues include prohibiting unauthorized access to devices, applications, and the company network; preventing users from installing unauthorized software and hardware; and blocking unauthorized Web access.\n\nOrganizations make serious efforts to establish company-wide security policies, but they often lack the tools to enforce them.
