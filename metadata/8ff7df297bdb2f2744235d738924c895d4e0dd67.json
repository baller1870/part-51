This is the second of these films, released in 1976. Edited with Bruce Lee&amp;#039;s star power in mind, the film has an abundance of spectacular fight scenes.\n\nOverview:\tAfter Bruce Lee&amp;#039;s untimely death in 1973, and the global success of &quot;Enter The Dragon&quot;, two 90-minute feature films were created to capitalize on Lee&amp;#039;s worldwide stardom. The second of these films, &quot;Fury Of The Dragon&quot;, was released theatrically in 1976.\n\nStarring Bruce Lee as Kato and Van Williams as The Green Hornet, the 1960s crime-fighting duo--by day Britt Reid, publisher-editor of the Daily Sentinal, and his chauffeur-man servant Kato--battle relentlessly against the forces of urban evil.\n\nThis movie takes Kato and the Green Hornet on four epic adventures, including trying to stop a plot to oust a young prince of a foreign power and exposing two crooked cops, a case that leads to teh Green Hornet being wounded and then nearly killed. Kato and the Green Hornet are then pushed to the very limit by a well organized gang carrying out a million-dollar art heist, and using a fantastic ray gun to remove anyone in their path. Could this include our crime-fighting duo? Finally, the last adventure takes our heroes into the dark underworld of drug trafficking, testing all their skills in crime-fighting.\n\nEdited with Bruce Lee&amp;#039;s on-screen magnetism in mind, the film has an abundance of extra, spectacular fight scenes. &quot;Fury Of The Dragon&quot; represents one of the last unreleased Bruce Lee feature films, and is a must for all lovers of the martial arts and comic book heroes everywhere!\n\nCast: \tVan Williams  ||  Bruce Lee  ||  Wende Wagner  ||  Lloyd Gough  ||  Walter Brooke  ||  Edmund Hashim  ||  Susan Flannery  ||  Alberto Morin  ||  James Lanphier  ||  Bert Freed  ||  Brian Avery  ||  Nicholas Coster  ||  Barry Ford  ||  Jason Wingreen  ||  Bud Perkins  ||  Dick Dial  ||  Robert McQueeney  ||  Grant Woods \n\n_________________\nDo not break the share chain!
