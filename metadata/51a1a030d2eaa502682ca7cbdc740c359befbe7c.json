Set in Moscow under Stalin and in Jerusalem under Pilate, it has several story-lines where history, religion and politics are intertwined. The sacrifices of Master (Galibin), a talented author of a manuscript about the biblical Pontius Pilate, and Master's muse - Margarita (Kovalchuk), are paralleled by the biblical story of Ieshua in Ierushalaim, and the deceit of the cowardly ambiguous Pilate (Lavrov), whose character alludes to a Soviet leader. The reality is distorted by Satan Woland (Basilashvili), and his lieutenants, who are manipulating public events and people's lives by pushing the buttons of human weaknesses and sins. Margarita taps into Woland's power, trying to save Master. The character of Master is autobiographical, burning of his manuscript alludes to what Bulgakov himself did under threats from the Soviet authorities.\n\nMust See: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bulgakov&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bulgakov&lt;/a&gt;\nhttp://www.masterimargarita.eu/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51a1a030d2eaa502682ca7cbdc740c359befbe7c","amp;dn":"The+Master+and+Margaret+%5B2005%5D+divx+DVD-RiP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51a1a030d2eaa502682ca7cbdc740c359befbe7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,161,160,48,210,234,165,2,104,44,167,203,220,116,12,53,155,239,190,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
