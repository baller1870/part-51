We have \nreports from CBC correspondent, Nahlah Ayed inside Iraq. And feature interviews \nwith Washington Post columnist, David Ignatius and with Phil Donahue, once a \nfamous American talk show host, now the director of a moving documentary about \nthe Iraq war.\n\nAs we have followed the course of the Iraq war, we have seen a clear trajectory \nfrom early bravado, to confusion over the unanticipated chaos and now to a \nsense of failure, as the death count of American soldiers and Iraqi civilians \nmounts.\n\nThe majority of Americans now believe that the war was a mistake and the \nadministration of George W. Bush is confronting the difficult challenge of what \nto do next. The dilemma: how to declare some kind of victory and get out of \nIraq without further destabilizing the country and the region?\n\nBrian has always respected the shrewd analysis of David Ignatius. He is a \nrenowned diplomatic correspondent for the Washington Post who has covered the \nwars and upheavals of the Middle East for many years. Ignatius, by the way, is \nalso a writer of fabulous espionage novels. He has followed the dramatic arc \nof the Iraq war closely and joins Brian this week to discuss Washington&amp;#039;s \nawful dilemma.\n\nThe CBC is now one of the only major television networks with reporters inside \nIraq, so dangerous a place has it become. The CBC&amp;#039;s Nahlah Ayed and Margaret \nEvans and their crews are there this week sending back daily reports on the \nsituation on the ground. It&amp;#039;s a mixed and contradictory picture. We show two \nreports by Nahlah Ayed. In the first one, she examines the desperation of many \npeople in the capital as they struggle without basic services and constant \ndanger. In the second report, she travels with US soldiers who show her some \nevidence of their success in establishing security.\n\nA majority of Americans now disapprove of the way President George Bush is \nhandling Iraq. It wasn&amp;#039;t always like that. When he launched the war, Bush had \nstrong public and political support. Phil Donahue, the famous talk show host, \nwas among the minority who passionately denounced the war from the very \nbeginning, losing his TV show for his efforts. About a year ago, he met an \nAmerican soldier who was shot only a week after arriving in Iraq, leaving him \nparalyzed from the chest down. Donahue decided to track both the man&amp;#039;s life \nand the memorable vote in the Congress and Senate that gave Bush full \nauthority to invade Iraq. The film is called &quot;Body of War.&quot; Brian&amp;#039;s \nconversation with Donahue is lively and compelling.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Post Information\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPosted by............: festering leper\n\nPosted to............: alt.binaries.multimedia\n                       alt.binaries.tv\n                       alt.binaries.documentaries\n                       alt.binaries.multimedia.documentaries\n                       alt.binaries.tv.canadian\n\nRepost Policy........: None, sorry!
