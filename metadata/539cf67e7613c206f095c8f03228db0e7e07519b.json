They performed the following tunes:\n\nCrown Imperial\nThe Wee MacGregor\nDrum Solo\nDanny Boy\n\nThis was obviously taken from a broadcast of the show (most likely from a video). The sound quality it &quot;OK&quot;. There are a couple of minute slips during &quot;The Wee MacGregor&quot; and a very brief interval of static in &quot;Drum Solo&quot;. Otherwise it is a pretty good archive of the Lancer&amp;#039;s performance (though if someone should have the video, all the better!).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:539cf67e7613c206f095c8f03228db0e7e07519b","amp;dn":"27th+Lancers+Alumni%3A+1994+Finals+Exhibition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"539cf67e7613c206f095c8f03228db0e7e07519b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,156,246,126,118,19,194,6,240,149,200,240,50,40,219,14,126,7,81,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
