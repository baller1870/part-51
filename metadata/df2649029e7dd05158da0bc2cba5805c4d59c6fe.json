Again, thousands of terrified East Timorese have become \nrefugees. Lives have been taken and properties burnt and trashed, \nin fewer numbers this time. Now Xanana Gusmao walks in pain and \nweeps with his people.\n\nThe tiny country?s convulsions have given rise to an uncomfortable \nnotion, that it could be lurching towards failed statehood, that \nthe bold independence journey might derail into civil war. But the \nkey question of East Timor?s future is bound inextricably to the \npresent: What ? who ? is causing the present turmoil?\n\nFour Corners looks for an answer by peeling back the layers of this \nmulti-tiered conflict that pits soldier against policeman, easterner \nagainst westerner and prime minister against president.\n\nReporter Liz Jackson reports from East Timor?s capital Dili and the \noutlying mountains, tapping into the secret agendas and shifting \nalliances of key players and showing how their power struggles are \ngrinding down an already traumatised people.\n\nJackson broke the recent story of the claims by former Falintil \nfighters that they had been hired by Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri \nto kill and intimidate opponents ? an allegation denied by Alkatiri.\nThis report will also break news as well as providing insight into \nthe evolving tragedy of East Timor.\n\n____________________________________________________________Encoding__\n\nFile Name....: East Timor - Stoking the Fires (2006-TVRip-d0x).avi\nFile Size....: 399 MB (or 409,290 KB or 419,112,960 bytes)\nFrames.......: 624x368 (1.70:1) [=39:23] @ 0.193 bits/pixel\nVideo Codec..: XviD @ 1109 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: MP3 @ 128 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) CBR \n_________________________________________________________________d0x__\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df2649029e7dd05158da0bc2cba5805c4d59c6fe","amp;dn":"East+Timor+-+Stoking+the+Fires+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df2649029e7dd05158da0bc2cba5805c4d59c6fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,38,73,2,158,125,208,81,88,218,11,194,203,165,128,92,77,89,198,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
