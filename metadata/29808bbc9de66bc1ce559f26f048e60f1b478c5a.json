IN THIS VERSION 1.40 ALL FINDED BUGS WERE FIXED.\n\nThe main bugs were:\n- There is not BASS in Holy Diver (Dio) and Misirlou (Dick Dale);\n- In the shop, some char in OUTFITS freezen. \nThese bugs were fixed, and there is some news.\n\nNews in this version:\n- Metal Health - Quiet Riot is from Guitar Hero 2 Demo disc. In this version there is an other guitar solo.\n- It was included Trippolette (a good and hidden track from GH1) and Play With Me, played by Extreme.\n\nMusics are work fine in all levels, in all modes (CO-OP, FACE-OFF and Pro-FACE-OFF).\n\nMusics and Group names are changed.\n\nChars of: Axel, Pandora, Izzie and Grim are from GH Encore 80.\n\nTo save space were deleted video bonus, practice mode and intro. Because this, it were applied \\&quot;Never Fail\\&quot; cheats in all levels.\n\nYou are able to use the practice mode in TRAINING just in normal speed.\n\nTanks to: Cristiano, John Hawk, Bootmaker, Jack Thompson and Ozzyman.\n\n1.
