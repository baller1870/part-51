What is RAM Saver Pro?\n\n&quot;RAM Saver Pro&quot; is an easy-to-use RAM optimizer tool that will \nkeep your computer running faster. It increases the operation \nsystem performance by making more memory available for your \napplications.\n\n&quot;RAM Saver Pro&quot; will:\n- defragment system memory for faster access time;\n- increasing the efficiency of your CPU and Motherboard caches;\n- recover memory leaks from poorly behaved applications;\n- flush unused libraries temporarily out to disk and so on. \n\nUsing these optimization tricks will help your favorite \napplications and games will run faster and more \nefficiently - even on old computers.\n\n\nSystem requirements. \nOS Windows 98SE/Me/2000/XP/VISTA \nMinimum screen resolution 640x480 \nPentium processor and above \n16 Mb RAM \n5 Mb free disk space \n\n\n2. Features\n\n&quot;RAM Saver Pro&quot; program consists of two basic parts: \nSystem Tray - module and Control Panel.\n\nMain program features:\n- System Tray monitor;\n- Desktop RAM monitor;\n- Desktop CPU Usage monitor;\n- specialized Control Panel;\n- professional memory monitoring;\n- flexible memory optimization with \n  complete statistics output;\n- RAM benchmark test;\n- monitoring and control over the \n  processes which take place in the memory;\n- possibility to create ?boosted shortcuts?;\n- common and advanced options;\n- automatic and intelligent optimization;\n- fast run of tools;\n- forced cleaning of Clipboard;\n- possibility to close all programs for \n  full memory release by one click;\n- control over Windows uptime;\n- suppressing and fast running of screen \n  savers;\n- check the presence of disk in CD-ROM \n  drive in the moment of computer shut down;\n- manipulating with desktop icons;\n- forced shut down and restart of computer;\n- fast access to Control Panels;\n...\n\n\n3.
