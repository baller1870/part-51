Communication Breakdown        cut at end\n6. Gallows Pole      cut at start\n7. The Girl Can&amp;#039;t Help It\n8. How Many More Times\n\n\nCame home this week to find a message for me, it was thanking me for the download of \n70.09.19 MSG, NY - &amp;#039;American Woman&amp;#039;.\n\nSpoke to the guy and said he wanted to hear how it sounded compared to his version.\nHe said he taped the show himself back in 70. He asked me if I wanted to download his version.\nI did,  and here it is, many thanks for the download.\n\nI have not heard a version of this show ( or seen any setlist ) that contain the last 3 songs listed above.\n\nThe sound on this show is far better than the &amp;#039;American Woman&amp;#039; version.\n\nIt was the last show of that US tour 70.09.19 and you can hear plant saying to the audience that something sad\nhappened yesterday,  Hendrix died.   I checked, he died on 18th Sept 70,  the day before this show.\n\nHope you enjoy this show as much as I do.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c41fed06f584376ba4cccf1e4abe5d53a41dd9fb","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+09.19.70+-+Madison+Square+Garden+-+The+Evening+Sh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c41fed06f584376ba4cccf1e4abe5d53a41dd9fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,31,237,6,245,132,55,107,164,204,207,30,74,190,93,83,164,29,217,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
