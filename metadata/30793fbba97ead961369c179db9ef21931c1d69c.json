Answer: So horny old fat men can  watch each of the hot babes in long shower scenes, dressing and running around in the rest of the movie in skimpy thong lingerie and getting wet while wearing aformentioned garb when they run out in the rain. Or at least that is how these type movies should be written and shot. This one is. Most others, sadly, aren&amp;#039;t. Instead of the proper formula, most other slasher movies kill the most beautiful, largest breasted (dumbest) chick first without a nude scene and then for the rest of the movie we get to watch a few mediocre looking chicks and plenty of dudes running around getting chopped up and if we are unlucky, one or two of the scroty-looking chicks&amp;#039; naked tits.\nSpoiler: 4 of the 5 chicks in this flick are extremely hot, sexy, scantily clad or naked for almost the entire film. The fifth chick is too, but she&amp;#039;s too short and has too obviously-fake breasts. \nDivxRipBy RUBrTOE\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30793fbba97ead961369c179db9ef21931c1d69c","amp;dn":"Sorority+House+Massacre+2+-+DivxRipBy+RUBrTOE.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30793fbba97ead961369c179db9ef21931c1d69c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,121,63,187,169,126,173,150,19,105,193,121,219,158,242,25,49,193,214,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
