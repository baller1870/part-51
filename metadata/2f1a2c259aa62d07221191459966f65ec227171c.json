He&amp;#039;s a former failed English literature student, a former taxi driver, and a former hit man for the Chicago mob. And through an unlucky series of events, he is currently a zombie slave of a voodoo priestess and the shirtless superhero of the afterlife - a place called Deadside. Five demonic serial killers have elected to marshal the forces of the undead and loose them upon the world of the living, or Liveside in voodoo talk. And only one man can save the world from this hellish fate - one shadow man.\n\nINSTALL NOTES:\nMount SHADOWMAN1.bin with Daemon tools and install game. When done, apply the shadowmanpatch2 and play the game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f1a2c259aa62d07221191459966f65ec227171c","amp;dn":"SHADOWMAN1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f1a2c259aa62d07221191459966f65ec227171c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,26,44,37,154,166,45,7,34,17,145,69,153,102,246,94,194,39,23,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
