Use Xchange Agent to transfer vital information to and from a portable computer, or to back up important files.

Whether your computer is controlling or being controlled, you have the same setup and start-up procedures. You can even copy information from one computer and paste it on the other. \n Print Redirection - You can print a document from a remote computer to your local printer over Remote Control, or print local documents to a printer at a remote location. This means you don&amp;#039;t have to use File Transfer to get documents printed where you want them. \n Text Chat - You can exchange messages with someone at a remote computer by typing messages in a window. This is useful if you need to communicate with the person at the other end while performing other services like File Transfer and Remote Control. Text Chat information is saved, and you can also cut and paste text into the Text Chat window.\n Voice Chat - You can talk with someone at a remote computer while you perform other services like File Transfer and Remote Control.
