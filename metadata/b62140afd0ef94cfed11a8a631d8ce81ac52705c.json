The PC version does not utilise the Xbox 360 engine but is a conversion of the PS2 edition. The PSP version is similar in many ways to its PS2 brother, while the DS version will have graphics and gameplay reminiscent to the older PES series on PSone. The DS and PSP versions were originally targeted for release on the 3rd November, but have been delayed to 10th December and 1st December respectively.\n\nA criticism of the previous version was that the game was too unforgiving and so suppressed fluid attacking football. Pro Evolution Soccer 6 promises to &amp;#039;embrace the beautiful game&amp;#039; with more tricks and an overall more attacking mentality, making it easier to take on defenders and get forward. More licenses are included, including fully licensed international kits with England, Spain and Italy to name a few (as well as the ever present Japan license). The French Ligue 1 is now included as fully licensed league, as well as the Spanish, Italian and Dutch leagues, plus several other individual clubs, however due to a lawsuit Konami were forced to drop the Bundesliga license and is not be present in PES6, not even as a series of unlicensed teams, only Bayern Munich survive.\n\nThe Xbox 360 version features next-generation, Hi-Definition graphics and more animations, but gameplay similar to the console versions, according to a recent interview with Seabass. Surprising though in PES6, close-up replay detail of the players (especially of the face and hair detail) is not as good as the previous version, PES5. The Xbox 360 version also finally introduces the Pro Evolution series to widescreen gaming, a feature that was sorely missing from its PS2 and Xbox versions of the game. Some of the gameplay and editing options have been severely stripped down for the 360 release (not even team or stadium names can be edited in PES6, although an option file has been released with changed team names, proving team names can be change with a hack citation needed In addition it is not possible to save replays on the Xbox 360 version despite the manual claiming that it can be done. Whether or not Konami will release a fix for this on the popular Xbox Live service remains to be seen. A new DS version is set, with gameplay and graphics reminiscent to the Playstation Pro Evolution Soccer games.\n\n* Although players retire in the game, the players reincarnate later, available as 17-year olds in the &quot;Newcomers&quot; section.\n* The licences found in the game are for:\n\nLeagues: Primera Division (Liga EspaÃƒÂ±ola), Serie A, Ligue 1, Premier League (partially licensed), Eredivisie\nDifferent Clubs: Bayern Munich, FC Porto, Galatasaray, Benfica Lisboa, Sporting Lisboa, Celtic, Rangers FC, Olympiakos, Fenerbahce, Besiktas, Kopenhagen, Juventus\n\n* The UK version of PES 6 has Adriano alongside England and Chelsea captain John Terry (who, together with Arsenal&amp;#039;s Thierry Henry poses on the cover of Pro Evolution Soccer 5) as its cover stars.
