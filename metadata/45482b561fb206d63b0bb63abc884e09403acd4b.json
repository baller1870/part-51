This disturbing documentary examines both the legal and \nthe illegal aspects of the multibillion dollar wildlife trade.\n\nAs a result of the multi-billion dollar trade in wildlife worldwide, \nthousands of animal species are poised on the brink of extinction. \nThis disturbing documentary examines both the legal and illegal \naspects of this trade. \n\nMore than 20 years ago the UN Convention on International Trade \nin Endangered Species (CITES) was established to stop the illegal \ntrade in wild animals and plants. Few countries devote the proper \nresources to enforce it. Today the demand for exotic pets, the \nwhims of fashion, and the quest for rare animal parts used in folk \nmedicines, are all taking a visible toll on animals worldwide.\n\nCultural and economic causes for the wildlife trade are examined. \nBoth eastern and western attitudes towards animals, though different, \nhave the same disastrous effect on wildlife. There is one success \nstory, the Wildlife Forensics Lab in Ashland, Oregon. The time for \naction is now.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bullfrogfilms.com/catalog/wfs.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bullfrogfilms.com/catalog/wfs.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nMore related uploads: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/BhangWalla&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/BhangWalla&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45482b561fb206d63b0bb63abc884e09403acd4b","amp;dn":"CBC.Wild.Life.For.Sale.Dead.Or.Alive-Nature.Of.Things.XViD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45482b561fb206d63b0bb63abc884e09403acd4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,72,43,86,31,178,6,214,59,11,182,58,188,136,78,9,64,58,205,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
