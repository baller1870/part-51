Perfect Angel\n9.General Relativity Jam\n\n\nA marriage of European and American talent, J.A.M. is a mixture of hard-edged rock and blues fusion, pop rock, even ballads; all immersed in some seriously O.T.T. soloing from some of the finest musicians in the business.\n\nJoel Rivard, Alessandro Benvenuti and Milan Polak all possess a wealth of experience under their belt, having performed live many times and having contributed to several musical projects utilising many diverse styles. J.A.M. witnesses a collaboration of the highest, with each player writing 3 songs over which the others solo.\n\nThe project also features keyboard maestro, Lale Larson (last heard on LNR&amp;#039;s Richard Hallebeek Project CD). J.A.M. is a feast of fantastic musicianship and unrestrained virtuoso playing which absolutely CANNOT be missed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d7c9bfb999a52bb577cbf9863a6492d220d36a2","amp;dn":"alessandro+benvenuti+-+2004+-+JAM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d7c9bfb999a52bb577cbf9863a6492d220d36a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,124,155,251,153,154,82,187,87,124,191,152,99,166,73,45,34,13,54,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
