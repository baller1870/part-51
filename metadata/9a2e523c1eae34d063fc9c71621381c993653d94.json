Ogg is usually the container format for Vorbis, a much better audio       ??\n??  format than MP3. If you didn&amp;#039;t know that, why did you download this?      ??\n??                                                                            ??\n??  These days most stuff can playback Vorbis, including your bloody Winamp,  ??\n??  and even your Symbian cellphone. Under Windows, we recommend foobar2000.  ??\n??                                                                            ??\n??  An XSPF playlist is added as well for comedy purposes. Use it as you      ??\n??  would use an M3U playlist; assuming that you&amp;#039;re using a decent player.    ??\n??                                                                            ??\n??  - Okay, but what is this HV-1? -                                          ??\n??                                                                            ??\n??  TTFG was the first group to ever coin the HV profiles. It stands for      ??\n??  Hatter Vorbis, and there&amp;#039;s two of them. The HV-1 is an audiophile         ??\n??  profile, whereas the HV-2 is an all-purposes profile (think podcasts,     ??\n??  online radio, or people who do not care about quality).                   ??\n??                                                                            ??\n??  Technically, HV-1 means that the original CD was (in most cases) ripped   ??\n??  with EAC properly set, then encoded with the latest aoTuV encoder at an   ??\n??  average 256 kbps with impulse noisetune set to -10. Replay Gain tags are  ??\n??  added at the end of the process.                                          ??\n??                                                                            ??\n??  - Why not FLAC? -                                                         ??\n??                                                                            ??\n??  FLAC is huge, and mostly useless for the Internet, or portable players.   ??\n??  It&amp;#039;s pretty awesome when you are making an archive of your own original   ??\n??  music, but aside that there&amp;#039;s really few purposes for FLAC in real life.  ??\n??  You CANNOT tell the difference between an HV-1 rip such as this, and      ??\n??  a FLAC one. Oh, and surely you store all your pictures in PNG, right?     ??\n??                                                                            ??\n??  - Why do you guys do this? -                                              ??\n??                                                                            ??\n??
