( Details is shown in the windows help. ) This record-breaking program was ported to personal computer environment such as Windows NT and Windows 95 and called Super PI. In order to calculate 33.55 million digits, it takes within 3 days with Pentium 90MHz, 40MB main memory and 340MB available storage. \n\nThe software is free and the circulation of program is also free!\n\n\n*** You can test your CPU speed and compare it to others ***","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:766c65e9b53453dc2f9715a8e11e4790020628a2","amp;dn":"SUPER+PI+v1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"766c65e9b53453dc2f9715a8e11e4790020628a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,108,101,233,181,52,83,220,47,151,21,168,225,30,71,144,2,6,40,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
