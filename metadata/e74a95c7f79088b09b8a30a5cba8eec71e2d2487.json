I included the labels I made using Memorex Label Maker (so you must have that program to print the labels). I spent countless hours making this cd for my family for Christmas. It&amp;#039;s a pretty good collection of the Disney cds that I grew up with. CDs included are:\n1)Children&amp;#039;s Favorite Songs Vol 1\n2)Children&amp;#039;s Favorite Songs Vol 2\n3)Children&amp;#039;s Favorite Songs Vol 3\n4)Children&amp;#039;s Favorite Songs Vol 4\n5)Disney&amp;#039;s Greatest Volume 1\n6)Disney&amp;#039;s Greatest Volume 2\n7)Disney&amp;#039;s Greatest Volume 3\n8)Silly Songs\n9)More Silly Songs\n10) Pardners\n\nPardners is a long lost tape that I finally found the cd of and was hence able to rip it. Enjoy and seed please!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e74a95c7f79088b09b8a30a5cba8eec71e2d2487","amp;dn":"Walt+Disney+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e74a95c7f79088b09b8a30a5cba8eec71e2d2487","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,74,149,199,247,144,136,176,155,138,48,165,203,168,238,199,30,45,36,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
