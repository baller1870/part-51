Same sort of topics etc. But I always end up feeling as if I have received more information from Kevin&amp;#039;s 2-hour show, than what I&amp;#039;m getting from Coast&amp;#039;s 4-hour show.\n\nIf you like Coast To Coast AM, chances are that you will like this show, as well.\n\nLearn more @ www.kevinsmithshow.com\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdc6d3a9929221af7232022a21bb2f0bfce376aa","amp;dn":"Kevin+Smith+Show+%5B09.06.07%5D+Stan+Deyo.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdc6d3a9929221af7232022a21bb2f0bfce376aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,198,211,169,146,146,33,175,114,50,2,42,33,187,47,11,252,227,118,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
