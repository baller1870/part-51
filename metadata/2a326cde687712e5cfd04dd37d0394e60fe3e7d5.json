I did some tracking and I guess that this is the dvd that has been going for quite some money lately so here is a backup of you investment.\n\nspoken languages are English &amp; French\n\nSubtitles are English &amp; Spanish\n\nAudio is AC3 2-channel, AC3 5.1 surround, and DTS 5.1 surround\n\nall extras and entire disc is intact from the original.\n\nI used dvd shrink to make the iso so use dvd shrink to rip and burn it.\n\nwhen I backed up this movie I used high settings for analyzing and at maximum sharpness. these are the settings that I use for all dvd&amp;#039;s i backup so there is less of a loss in quality. the only loss you would see is in the menues unless the dvd was a dvd5 format in the first place, then there is no loss in quality.\n\nI hope this has made the halloween season bright for all.\n\nMore info on the movie @ &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nightmare_Before_Christmas&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nightmare_Before_Christmas&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a326cde687712e5cfd04dd37d0394e60fe3e7d5","amp;dn":"Nightmare+Before+Christmas+-+NTSC+%28FULL+2000+Special+Ed.%21%21%21%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a326cde687712e5cfd04dd37d0394e60fe3e7d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,50,108,222,104,119,18,229,207,208,77,211,125,3,148,230,15,227,231,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
