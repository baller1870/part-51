He\\&amp;#039;s got a nose for danger, a penchant for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and a talent for overcoming incredible odds. But, this time, danger is looking for him. Seeking a personal and mysterious revenge against McClane, a malevolent genius named Simon is forcing the heroic cop to play a deadly game. The stakes: New York City itself. But, does Simon have a hidden agenda? The game begins when a phone call from Simon sends McClane to Harlem, where he unexpectedly forms an alliance with an unwilling Zeus Carver. McClane and Zeus soon find themselves careening across The Big Apple, pursuing Simon and solving his deadly riddles. But, Simon is somehow always one step ahead.\n\nDVDFab Gold+AnyDVD, DVDRemake Pro, DVDRebuilder Pro+CEE 4 pass\n\n-- Building .AVS and .ECL files\n- Reduction Level for DVD-5: 60.8%\n- Overall Bitrate : 3\\&amp;#039;567Kbs\n- Space for Video : 3\\&amp;#039;210\\&amp;#039;920KB\n- HIGH/LOW/TYPICAL Bitrates: 4\\&amp;#039;034/1\\&amp;#039;701/3\\&amp;#039;567 Kbs\n\nPLEASE VISIT WWW.DVDQUORUM.ES Ã‚Â¡Ã‚Â¡Ã‚Â¡NOW IN ENGLISH!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c6cf8f1f89203bd4f0e19e8822e76d3677e73a1","amp;dn":"Die+Hard%3A+With+a+Vengeance.+E.E.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c6cf8f1f89203bd4f0e19e8822e76d3677e73a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,108,248,241,248,146,3,189,79,14,25,232,130,46,118,211,103,126,115,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
