For the first time the user can even combine different types of route sections.\n\nSIDÃ‚Â´s and STARÃ‚Â´s are also included as well as an automatic logbook and a direct download and a monthly update of DAFIFF files (Route Data).\n\nMore unique features in this program are included in the Moving Map which can display all surrounding aircraft, even AI aircraft in the air and on the ground. The Moving Map shows all airspaces and altitude restrictions as well as a parking aid for easy identification of the gates.\n\nThe separate GPS window displays waypoint, arrival, airport, route information and the arrival ILS with an automatic frequency transmission on the radio panel. The virtual pilot can call up the weather report in METAR format at any given time.\n\nFlightSim Commander 7 is also compatible with WideFS.\n\n\nxxx.aerosoft.com/cgi-local/re/iboshop.cgi?showd,4418206400,FS02089\n\n------\nNOTAM:\n------\nYou can update the SID\\&amp;#039;s/STAR\\&amp;#039;s via the Navigrapgh-data.
