On Renaissance of course.\n\nJohn says: &quot;Musically speaking, I?ve been shifting through the gears \nover the series, he says and we?re now approaching top speed. This mix \nstill represents an immediate snapshot of my favourite tunes and producers, \nbut it?s also about that specific energy you get at 3 or 4 am at the best \nclubs or festivals around the world&quot;\n\nTo capture and realise this John worked a whopping 20 tracks into the \nalbum. \n\n&quot;Running the tracklist up so high was a conscious decision, he \nelaborates, it allowed me to generate that energy and atmosphere, which \nI further reinforced by creating exclusive edits.\n\nEvery track on T3 has been given the magic touch by continuous layering \nnd in the overall running time the passages where there isn?t a mix running \nare actually shorter than those where they are. It?s an intense ride which \nin true Digweed fashion builds over its 78-minute excursion. The mix kicks \noff with Sasha?s elusively titled ?Coma ?. Moving on highlights include the \ninnovative use of Lawrence?s ?Along The Wire?, broken down and part-used \nthroughout its neighbours ?Sweet N Candy? and ?Einzelkind?. \n\nThe Dusty Kid / Aldo Kadiz mash-up, ?Begun The End Has? from Harthouse \nregular Joel Mull, the incredible Josh Wink remix of ?Someone Else? and \nGui Boratto?s emotive interpretation of Adam Freeland?s latest, \n?Silverlake Pills? are similarly outstanding.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53bad7889e20f3e39c0cd582ba09af9b279717b9","amp;dn":"VA+Transitions+Volume+3++Mixed+By+John+Digweed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53bad7889e20f3e39c0cd582ba09af9b279717b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,186,215,136,158,32,243,227,156,12,213,130,186,9,175,155,39,151,23,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
