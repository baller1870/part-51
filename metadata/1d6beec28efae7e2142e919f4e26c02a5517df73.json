There are no adverts, but there is the occasional overlap of the \\\\\\&amp;#039;five\\\\\\&amp;#039; commentary team of Martin Bayfield and Mike Carlson, lead by the excellent Mr Carlson.  I find it very worthwhile to listen to Carlson, but in this case, I\\\\\\&amp;#039;ve removed the commentary, assuming that die-hard fans of the NFL won\\\\\\&amp;#039;t want to watch him.\n\nThe 2 files contain the first and second halves of the game in DivX AVI format.  The audio format is MPEG Layer-3 at 191 kbps and the video DivX codec with a data rate of 267 kbps and a sample rate of 24 bit.\n\nThe files were recorded from the UK\\\\\\&amp;#039;s digital signal straight to my Archos AV380.  After recording I edited the files on the Archos to remove unwanted stuff.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d6beec28efae7e2142e919f4e26c02a5517df73","amp;dn":"NFL_SNF_week_10_CHaNYG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d6beec28efae7e2142e919f4e26c02a5517df73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,107,238,194,142,250,231,226,20,46,145,159,78,38,192,42,85,23,223,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
