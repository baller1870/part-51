Award-winner Kelsey Grammer is Frasier -- the hilarious psychiatrist first seen on TV?s Cheers and subsequently the star of this smash-hit comedy series. In the complete third season of this acclaimed sitcom, Frasier (Grammer) has encounters with both a woman from his past -- Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) -- and one in his future, in the form of new radio station manager Kate Costas (Mercedes Ruehl). Niles (David Hyde Pierce) is kicked out of the house by wife Maris; Martin (John Mahoney) is exposed as a budding songwriter for Frank Sinatra; and both Daphne (Jane Leeves) and Roz (Peri Gilpin) attract some not-so-secret secret admirers! You?ll enjoy non-stop laughs in all 24 episodes of Frasier?s unrestrained third season presented in this four-disc collection.\n\nEnjoy\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1923242b1aa0bc89ffc151fdf49199a1a16efbde","amp;dn":"Frasier+Season+3+DVD+4+eng-spa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1923242b1aa0bc89ffc151fdf49199a1a16efbde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,35,36,43,26,160,188,137,255,193,81,253,244,145,153,161,161,110,251,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
