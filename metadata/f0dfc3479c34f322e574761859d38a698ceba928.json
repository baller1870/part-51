If so, chances are you listened to Oasis while doing so, but what many people don\\\\\\&amp;#039;t realize is that Oasis was a live band at heart. Their studio albums are shit compared to a live show like CIA\\\\\\&amp;#039;96 or especially Earls Court (the best set of shows Oasis ever did).\n\nHere is a collection of the very best Oasis shows during their glory years (when they did a lot of drugs and knew how to make good music). Some good shows are left out for various reasons: Live By the Sea Southend Cliffs is missing because it\\\\\\&amp;#039;s been released officially, as has There &amp; Then. Utretch and Wolverhampton are missing because, while soundboards, their audio is less than stellar. Earls Court Night One is missing because only one soundboard of it exists to my knowledge, and the quality is very low for a soundboard. Ridiculous, considering Night One was the basis for the There &amp; Then VHS/DVD.\n\nDon\\\\\\&amp;#039;t ask for missing shows, I don\\\\\\&amp;#039;t fill requests. Take it or leave it. Here is what you\\\\\\&amp;#039;ll be taking if you choose to:\n\n1994-06-02 - Gleneagles Golf Club\n1994.10.15 - Cabaret Metro, Chicago, IL, USA\n1995-01-29 - Commodore Ballroom, Vancouver, Canada\n1995-06-23 &amp; 24 - Glastonbury Festival, England\n1995-10-14 - Orpheum Theater, Boston, MA, USA\n1995.05.11 - Earls Court Night Two\n1996-03-17 - International Arena, Cardiff, Wales\n1996-04-27 - Maine Road.(Live.In.Manchester)\n1996-08-10 &amp; 11 - Knebworth Park, Stevenage, England\n1996.03.07 - GMU Patriot Center, Fairfax, VA, USA\n1997-08-10 - Hammerstein Ballroom\n1997-11-27 - Brabanthallen, Den Bosch, Holland\n1997-12-14 - G-Mex Centre, Manchester, England\n1998-01-17 - Chicago Rosemont\n\nEvery single show is a soundboard recording. Some may have minor omissions (unlikely) or glitches (definitely) because these are bootlegs that have been passed between fans both on and off the internet for a decade. \n\nEnjoy them. I do. Every single night. Cheers from The Roman Empire... er, America.\n\nTorrent note: I will seed this for a week, and only a week. \n\nEVERY FILE IN THIS TORRENT IS \\\\\\&quot;SAFE\\\\\\&quot; TO DOWNLOAD (though probably not fully \\\\\\&quot;legal\\\\\\&quot;), AS NO FILE FROM THIS PACK HAS EVER BEEN RELEASED COMMERCIALLY. \n\nThere is a whole site dedicated to Oasis bootlegs here, and they\\\\\\&amp;#039;ve been up for years with not a single complaint from the RIAA:\n\nhxxp://www.live4ever.us \n\n(bootleg forum is where the downloads are, ignore the site hosted DLs they are terrible)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0dfc3479c34f322e574761859d38a698ceba928","amp;dn":"Feelin%5C%27+Supersonic+-+The+Best+Live+Soundboards+From+The+Oasis+G","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0dfc3479c34f322e574761859d38a698ceba928","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,223,195,71,156,52,243,34,229,116,118,24,89,211,138,105,140,235,169,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
