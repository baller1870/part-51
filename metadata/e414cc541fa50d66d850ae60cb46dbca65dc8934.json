It is used for screen capturing, recording and benchmarking. Meaning it can record what is on your screen in video, you can take screenshots of what?s on your screen, and display your FPS (Frames Per Second) no matter what you are doing. Mainly gamers find this useful for recording and screenshotting, as well as the FPS counter you get. Whether your a gamer or not though, people may still find this useful for screen capturing.\n\nFraps is a universal Windows application that can be used with games using DirectX or OpenGL graphic technology. In its current form Fraps performs many tasks and can best be described as:\n\n* Benchmarking Software - Show how many Frames Per Second (FPS) you are getting in a corner of your screen. Perform custom benchmarks and measure the frame rate between any two points. Save the statistics out to disk and use them for your own reviews and applications.\n\n* Screen Capture Software - Take a screenshot with the press of a key! There?s no need to paste into a paint program every time you want a new shot. Your screen captures are automatically named and timestamped.\n \n* Realtime Video Capture Software - Have you ever wanted to record video while playing your favourite game? Come join the Machinima revolution! Throw away the VCR, forget about using a DV cam, game recording has never been this easy! Fraps can capture audio and video up to 2560Ãƒâ€”1600 on dual-core CPUs (1152Ãƒâ€”864 single-core) at up to 100 frames per second!\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\n    * Windows 2000, XP, 2003, Vista and x64 Editions\n\nRelease Name: Beepa.Fraps.v2.9.2.6725-DVT\nSize: 3.02 MB (3,163,938 bytes), dv93abe1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e414cc541fa50d66d850ae60cb46dbca65dc8934","amp;dn":"Beepa+Fraps+v2.9.2.6725-DVT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e414cc541fa50d66d850ae60cb46dbca65dc8934","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,20,204,84,31,165,13,102,216,80,174,96,203,70,219,202,101,220,137,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
