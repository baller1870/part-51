Pakula \nSCREENWRITER: William Goldman (Book: Carl Bernstein &amp; Bob Woodward) \nCOMPOSER: David Shire \nCAST: Robert Redford, Dustin Hoffman, Jack Warden, Jason Robards, Martin Balsam, Jane Alexander, Hal Holbrook \n\nGENRE: Mystery / Drama \nSYNOPSIS: In ALL THE PRESIDENT&amp;#039;S MEN, director Alan Pakula adapts the best-selling book by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. Pakula created a film that takes its place among such important conspiracy dramas as THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR and THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH. The focus is on the 1972 investigation of the break-in to the Democratic Party headquarters, otherwise known as the Watergate burglary. Through a complicated web of intrigue and secrecy that eventually involves the \nhighest levels of government, hungry young journalists Woodward (Robert Redford) and Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) of the Washington Post aggressively examine the incident, ultimately leading to the resignation of President Richard Nixon. Exceptional performances by Redford and Hoffman are complemented by Jason Robards as the dubious but supportive executive editor at the Post, and Hal Holbrook&amp;#039;s celebrated characterization of mysterious informer Deep Throat. The pacing of the film is quick and exciting, drawing viewers into the action of one of the most intriguing mysteries in all of American political history. \n\nDVD9 to DVD5\nPAL - 16:9\n2.0 Dolby Digital.
