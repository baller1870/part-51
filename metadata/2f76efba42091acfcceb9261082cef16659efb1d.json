BWMeter, as the name suggests, is a bandwidth meter/monitor, and is perfect for home or small business. TE?s release comes with a Serial/Activation crack, but you should probably read the NFO for more info on installing.\n\nBWMeter is a powerful bandwidth meter, monitor and traffic controller, which measures, displays and controls all traffic to/from your computer or on your network. Unlike other products, it can analyze the data packets (where they come from, where they go, which port and protocol they use). This makes it possible to distinguish between local and internet traffic for example. BWMeter can also be used for traffic control by setting a speed limit for all kinds of connections or restricting access to certain internet sites. It creates statistics for all computers in your network, measuring and displaying all LAN traffic as well as download / upload from the internet. You can even define filters which show your transfer with certain internet addresses (e.g. to see how much data you download from your favorite news server). BWMeter is ideal for home users to get an overview of how much bandwidth they use, as well as small to large businesses, where one computer can control the traffic and maintain the statistics of downloaded / uploaded data of all computers in the network.\n\nProgram Features:\n\n    * Graphical and numerical display of bandwidth\n    * User definable filters for measuring bandwidth\n    * User definable graphs to visualize bandwidth\n    * Can monitor all network interfaces / adapters\n    * Can monitor and display all traffic on the network\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\n    * Windows 95, 98, ME, NT 4.0, 2000, XP, 2003 or Vista, 32 bit only\n\nRelease Name: BWMeter.v3.2.3-TE\nSize: 0.53MB, te-bm323","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f76efba42091acfcceb9261082cef16659efb1d","amp;dn":"BWMeter+v3.2.3-TE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f76efba42091acfcceb9261082cef16659efb1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,118,239,186,66,9,26,207,204,235,146,97,8,44,239,22,101,158,251,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
