Psychologically speaking, an archetype is a primordial mental image inherited by all. For example, personifications of Anger, Death, Love, War and Peace all play their part in our visions of life. ArcheDream?s costumes are illuminated with ultra-violet light, which accentuates the supernatural aspect and reveals the dreamscape as the action unfolds.\n\nwww.archedream.com\n\n- - -\n\nVisual Artists\n\n\nMIZUE KATAOKA\n(Japan)\n\nSince last year&amp;#039;s Gaian Mind festival, MIZUE has been transforming party spaces in NY, PA, DC, NJ, Tokyo, and Niigata, featuring artists such as Absolum, Space Tribe, Alex Grey, Deviant Species, FREq, Infected Mushroom, Kenji Williams, Ocelot, Paranormal Attack, Penta, Planet B.E.N., Savage Scream, Talamasca, and some of the finest talent the USA&amp;#039;s East Coast and Tokyo have to offer.\n\nAlways busy making new artwork, and always trying new arrangements, no two parties look the same when they are decorated by Mizue.\n\nCurrently in Tokyo, MIZUE is hard at work to fulfill her promise of unveiling a complete series of fresh new pieces made specially for the Stone Circle at Gaian Mind Summer Festival 2006!\n\nPrepare to be mesmerized, again.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mizuekataoka.tripod.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mizuekataoka.tripod.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nOPTICAL DELUSION\n(NYC)\n\nwww.opticaldelusion.com\n\n\nREALITY ENGINE\n(Reality Engine - NYC)\n\nReality Engine is a multi-media art collective that creates an interactive Audio-Visual experience.

His fascination with visual art and virtual reality began early in life. He got into black &amp; white photography and creative writing at the age of 7! After expressing himself through various art forms, such as drawing, painting, poetry, sculpting, music, and dancing, he became increasingly aware of the infinite realms that lie beyond the imagination. Torsten traveled more than 10 years non-stop. During that time he developed a profound mystical understanding. When his talent for moving pictures was discovered, he began filming heavily, learning the hard way - through trial and error. He usually carried a 35mm photo camera, a digital video camera, a DAT recorder, and microphones on his journeys. Omananda is a producer, director, editor, camera man, film maker, and VJ - all in one person. In Liquid Crystal Vision his intuitive cat-style-videography and the superb editing fashion that are so typical for his unique style found its full self-expression. As a VJ, he has an incredible talent of mixing graphics live - absolutely magical and psychedelic!\n\nwww.omananda.com\nwww.liquidcrystalvision.net\n\n\nSTEVE-O\n(GoaBabies - NYC/Rincon)\n\n- - -\n\nSpecial Guest\n\n\nDANIEL PINCHBECK\n(Evolver Project - NYC)\n\nDaniel Pinchbeck is one of the leading voices in today?s counter-culture, exploring the connections between psychedelics and shamanism and their importance in the modern era. Though he?s published feature articles in the New York Times Magazine, Esquire, Wired, The Village Voice and is a regular columnist in Arthur magazine, it was his 2003 book, Breaking Open the Head: A Psychedelic Journey into the Heart of Contemporary Shamanism, which seems to have really given him a higher profile among those interested in alternative religion and spirituality. He will be speaking in support of his forthcoming book, 2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl.\n\nwww.breakingopenthehead.com\nwww.evolverproject.com\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef6690065521fea7ad63f6fa9377b9c6ecd2ecab","amp;dn":"GMSF06","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef6690065521fea7ad63f6fa9377b9c6ecd2ecab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,102,144,6,85,33,254,167,173,99,246,250,147,119,185,198,236,210,236,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
