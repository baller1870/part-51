TerrorStorm delivers a powerful sucker punch to the architects of global terrorism and how they stage false-flag events to achieve political and sociological ends.\n\nAlex journeys from the depths of history from the Gulf of Tonkin, the USS Liberty and Gladio through to the Madrid and 7/7 London bombings and robustly catalogues the real story behind the government induced fable.\n\nThis film contains viable solutions on how we can reclaim human dignity and freedom and prevent the global population from becoming the slaves of a prison planet.\n\n&quot;A state of war only serves as an excuse for domestic tyranny.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e610ec663cb6ea12fc4bee8d735f408fb2aecf4c","amp;dn":"Terrorstorm%28Final-2006%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e610ec663cb6ea12fc4bee8d735f408fb2aecf4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,16,236,102,60,182,234,18,252,75,238,141,115,95,64,143,178,174,207,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
