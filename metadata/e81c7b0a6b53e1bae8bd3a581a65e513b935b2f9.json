The line-up of players includes the controversial Phil \n  Hellmuth (returning after a long absence) the legendary Doyle Brunson, \n  the charismatic Daniel Negreanu and 2006 WSOP champion Jamie Gold. \n  In addition, popular pros will also return including Mike &amp;#039;The Mouth&amp;#039; \n  Matusow, Jennifer Harman, Barry Greenstein, Eli Elezra, Phil \n  &amp;#039;Unabomber&amp;#039; Laak, Sammy Farha, and Todd Brunson. \n\n  Risking fame and fortune, the stakes have never been higher! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e81c7b0a6b53e1bae8bd3a581a65e513b935b2f9","amp;dn":"High.Stakes.Poker.S04E02.DSR.XviD-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e81c7b0a6b53e1bae8bd3a581a65e513b935b2f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,28,123,10,107,83,225,186,232,189,58,88,26,101,229,19,185,53,178,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
