While working there, his ideals gradually turn to suspicion influenced by the Cold War paranoia present within the office. Eventually, he becomes an influential veteran operative, while his distrust of everyone around him increases to no end. His dedication to his work does not come without a price though, leading him to sacrifice his ideals and eventually his family.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fe9934166d1a65a1672523fb9968cda6ad2b79b","amp;dn":"The+Good+Shepherd%28Nordic+subs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fe9934166d1a65a1672523fb9968cda6ad2b79b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,233,147,65,102,209,166,90,22,114,82,63,185,150,140,218,106,210,183,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
