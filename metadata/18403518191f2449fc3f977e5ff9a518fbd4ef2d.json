They are mainly known for their success in the mid 1980s and their jazzy, latino flavoured music.\n\nHugely popular during the mid 1980s in continental Europe, Matt Bianco epitomised the new Jazz Pop genre that they shared with Working Week, Sade and The Style Council. The band name suggests that Matt Bianco is a personal name, but Matt is &quot;a made up spy, a secret agent; we loved spy TV themes and film scores&quot;\n\nFormed by the late Kito Poncioni (bass), Mark Reilly (vocals), and Danny White (keyboards) in 1982 out of the shards of the abandoned art poppers Blue Rondo A La Turk, for their first album Whose Side Are You On? they hired unknown Polish vocalist Basia Trzetrzelewska. Her vocal arrangements gave the album a jazzy dimension that Reilly and White couldn&amp;#039;t anticipate but made good use of. Hits like &quot;Get Out of Your Lazy Bed&quot; and &quot;Half a Minute&quot; turned Matt Bianco into one of the biggest acts of Europe in 1984. \n\nMark Reilly and Mark Fisher are back as a duo and plan a new release in 2007.\n\nDiscography\n\n    * Whose Side Are You On?, released 1984\n    * Matt Bianco, released 1986\n    * Indigo, released 1988\n    * Samba In Your Casa, released 1991\n    * The Best of Matt Bianco: 1983-1990, released 1991\n    * Yeah Yeah, released 1993-07-13\n    * Another Time Another Place, released 1994\n    * Gran Via, released 1995\n    * A/Collection, released 1998\n    * World Go Round, released 1998\n    * Echoes, released 2002\n    * Matt&amp;#039;s Mood, released 2004\n    * The Best of Matt Bianco: Platinum Collection, released: 2005\n\n\n\n\n\t\t&quot;Fire in the Blood&quot; Tracklisting:\n\n   1.
