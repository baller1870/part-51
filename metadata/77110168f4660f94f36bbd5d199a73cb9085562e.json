I downloaded it and now I&amp;#039;m re-upping it.  It&amp;#039;s been released as freeware\n\nIt&amp;#039;s a vertical scrolling shooter I think is how it&amp;#039;s described.  I usually describe it as &quot;fun&quot;.\n\nThe orignal was made to run on DOS (yes it&amp;#039;s that old).  Version 2.1 (included) has timeing issues with faster processors (worked on a 400MHz AMD K6-III, did not work on an 850MHz slot A Athlon).  There is some programs out there to fix that, the one in the info I found was &quot;dosbox&quot; (included).  Later the game was given another level, made to work right with faster processors (works great on an AND Athlon 4400+ X2) and retitled &quot;Tyrian 2000&quot; (included x2).  The orignal creator of the program re-leased a disk image of the Tyrian 2k version (first copy, included; the .CCD, .IMG, and .SUB files are this one), but the program that he used (CloneCD, also included) didn&amp;#039;t make ISOs and my burning program (burn at one (not included) woudlnt&amp;#039; burn it.  I downloaded a copy of the CloneCD (included, not free but has a 21 day trial period) and created a disk with it and then made a disk image with my burn at once (second copy, included; that is the .dat and .toc files) since it&amp;#039;s freeware.\n\nBasicly, ther eisn&amp;#039;t anything that you can&amp;#039;t get someplace else in this, except you don&amp;#039;t have to go anyplace else, because it IS right here.\n\nPlease pick this up and re-seed it even if you don&amp;#039;t plan on playing it, I don&amp;#039;t know how long I can keep it seeded.\n\nThank you for your time;\nbdraft","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77110168f4660f94f36bbd5d199a73cb9085562e","amp;dn":"Tyrian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77110168f4660f94f36bbd5d199a73cb9085562e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,17,1,104,244,102,15,148,243,107,189,93,25,154,115,203,144,133,86,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
