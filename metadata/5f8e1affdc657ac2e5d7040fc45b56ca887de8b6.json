Gomer&amp;#039;s innocence, naivete and low-key demeanor often got him into trouble, most frequently at the hands of his loud-mouthed superior, Sgt. Carter. Duke, Frankie, Lester and Larry were some of Gomer&amp;#039;s pals and fellow enlisted men at Camp Henderson, and Lou Anne Poovie was his sometimes girlfriend who worked as a singer at the Blue Bird Cafe, where Gomer and the boys often hung out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f8e1affdc657ac2e5d7040fc45b56ca887de8b6","amp;dn":"Gomer+Pyle+USMC+S2-D-3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f8e1affdc657ac2e5d7040fc45b56ca887de8b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,142,26,255,220,101,122,194,229,215,4,15,196,91,86,202,136,125,232,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
