Agathon (vocals) got his first influences as a teenager from the bands like VENOM, HELLHAMMER and BATHORY.\nHELLSTORM ended quite soon, but the title \\&amp;#039;Fuck The World, Kill The Jehova!\\&amp;#039; remained. GLOOMY GRIM used it as the first demo name.\nThe folklore tells that HELLSTORM was the first black metal band in Finland. Agathon wanted to create dark music, music from the depth of the darkest pit of Hell\nand with no compromises from any other band members. Agathon started GLOOMY GRIM as a one-man band. The biggest inspiration has always been the dark life itself\nand the soundtracks of the horror films he collected. Agathon made four albums with a strong line-up.\nGLOOMY GRIM has also made some furious live shows in continental Europe and the Baltic states.\nAfter the latest album ( The Grand Hammering 2004 ) and +30 000 sold titles GLOOMY GRIM is back on his throne!\n\nGLOOMY GRIM\\&amp;#039;s new album will be released in early 2008.\n\nIn the meantime, you can download the \\&quot;Tapetum Lucidum\\&quot; EP for free at http://www.gloomy-grim.info/\n\nIncluded are: All songs, Bio &amp; Lyrics\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78913fa1d7a6e7e578ed8c858da0d69932457a3d","amp;dn":"Gloomy+Grim+-+Tapetum+Lucidum+-+Promo+EP+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78913fa1d7a6e7e578ed8c858da0d69932457a3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,145,63,161,215,166,231,229,120,237,140,133,141,160,214,153,50,69,122,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
