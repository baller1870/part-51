You can also remove the RPC region code,\nthereby making the movie region free and viewable on any DVD player and with any DVD player\nsoftware.\nAnyDVD is capable of removing unwanted movie features, including subtitles and prohibition\nmessages such as copyright and FBI warnings. It also allows you to launch an external\napplication whenever you insert or remove a disc, or prevent &amp;#039;PC-friendly&amp;#039; software from\nautomatically launching when you insert a video DVD.\nDecryption is not all that AnyDVD offers. You can control the drive speed of your DVD\ndrive, allowing you to reduce the noise level when watching movies on your PC. You can\neven adjust the display frequency of your monitor for both NTSC and PAL displays.\nBut AnyDVD doesn&amp;#039;t just stop at DVDs. It also decrypts protected audio CDs to allow you\nto copy them.\n\n\nInstall-Notes:\n==============\n\ninstall and check crack dir","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65eb9a1137b3298b90efc713889b14499b26abce","amp;dn":"SlySoft.AnyDVD.v6.1.0.2-YAG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65eb9a1137b3298b90efc713889b14499b26abce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,235,154,17,55,179,41,139,144,239,199,19,136,155,20,73,155,38,171,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
