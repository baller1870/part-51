The previous version (0.0.5) got confused if the ZIX archive contained unrecognized metainformation, such as folder structure information.\nThis should work okay now.\n\nIf you come across anything UnZixWin can\\&amp;#039;t handle, then use the e-mail address in the contact_info.txt file to let me know. I\\&amp;#039;ll take a look.\n\n&lt;strong&gt;Warning!&lt;/strong&gt; Don\\&amp;#039;t extract anything executable from a ZIX archive. It is highly likely to contain a virus or a trojan.\n\nAlso, don\\&amp;#039;t be tricked into installing any \\&amp;#039;codec patch\\&amp;#039; or any special player software to play the AVI inside. This is a trick to get you to compromise your system, much like WinZix does.\n\nCheers,\n//NeverShaveYourDuck\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4145e4b4192f6accdedd9ca7fbaf0939f165b429","amp;dn":"UnZixWin+0.0.6+-+Extract+contents+of+ZIX+archives","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4145e4b4192f6accdedd9ca7fbaf0939f165b429","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,69,228,180,25,47,106,204,222,221,156,167,251,175,9,57,241,101,180,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
