All they want is to re-start the silent machines. But this simple act - the take - has the power to turn the globalization debate on its head. Armed only with slingshots and an abiding faith in shop-floor democracy, the workers face off against the bosses, bankers and a whole system that sees their beloved factories as nothing more than scrap metal for sale. With The Take, director Avi Lewis, one of Canada&amp;#039;s most outspoken journalists, and writer Naomi Klein, author of the international bestseller No Logo, champion a radical economic manifesto for the 21st century.\n\nIn Spanish with English subtitles.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11a53b843209ecda4cbee8e099df76159f5cda3d","amp;dn":"The+Take+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11a53b843209ecda4cbee8e099df76159f5cda3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,165,59,132,50,9,236,218,76,190,232,224,153,223,118,21,159,92,218,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
