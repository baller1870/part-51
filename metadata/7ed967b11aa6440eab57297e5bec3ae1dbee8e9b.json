Combined with that and the new style of Goa that we are\nspreading we think this album will serve the Goa community very well.\n\nTomislav is Vox, born 1976 in Zagreb (Croatia) where he currently lives today. \nMusic and music creation on a computer became one of his interests not long\nafter geting his first computer, Commodore 128, about 1990. Serious first steps\nin music were made when he got an Amiga 500 about 1994, and discovered\nProTracker, music software that looks and somehow feels like Microsoft Excel.\n\nThat was time when his fascination with Rave culture started to take place.\nInspiration for the first tracks came from early trance, techno and hardcore\ntracks of the time, which were played on big Future shock rave parties held\nin 1990s in Zagreb. He discovered goa trance in around 1995, and it was love\nat first sight. He got his hands on many releases of international artists\nand started to play, and getting practice in DJ skills.\n\nBeing rather unhappy with the direction trance music was going in 1999 and\n2000, he decided to lay low for a while and later decided to start producing\nthe music he loved and wanted to listen to. And here we are today with the\nfirst Vox album!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMetapsychic would like to thank all the people who have supported our cause: \n\nDj Nick @ Shivlink records, Tranceform records, Dj Drashko, Dj Goangel,\nDj Amphiton, Beatbiz &amp; Acidplanet communities, Hadra.net, Old is Gold Team,\nBuddha Mantra, Serguei @ Tribal Dance, Chatnik aka Alien, Radio Powernet,\nManu @psysurfeur.com, Jon Gajos\n\nTo all the old goa artists and pionneers who gave us their golden musical\nheritage, and all those we have forgotten to mention there.\n\nAnd a final thanx to all the goa fans across the world. Consider this\ncompilation as a gift to all of you! \n                                      \n                                GOA is still alive!  \n\n   Metapsychic Team: Filipe &quot;Lost Buddha&quot; / Cosmogenesis / Martin &quot;oCtodur&quot;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNFO&amp;Layout magically appeared somewhere in the universe and found its way home.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ed967b11aa6440eab57297e5bec3ae1dbee8e9b","amp;dn":"Vox_-_Innerpolarity-2007-MPR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ed967b11aa6440eab57297e5bec3ae1dbee8e9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,217,103,177,26,166,68,14,171,87,41,126,91,236,58,225,219,238,142,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
