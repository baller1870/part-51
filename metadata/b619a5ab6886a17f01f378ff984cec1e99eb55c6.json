The Culture Show&amp;#039;s Verity Sharp is introducing them.\n\n# - Goggi, Jonsi, Kjarri and Orri take the stage. Jonsi says they&amp;#039;re just gonna play a few songs, and then it&amp;#039;s straight in.\n\n# - A baby grand, dry ice and beautiful scenery visuals for first song, &amp;#039;Vaka&amp;#039;.\n\n# - Some tired helium balloons stuck against the ceiling seem strangely fitting.\n\n# - Samskeyti Ageatis follows. The acoustic setting with drums played with brushes translates, nicely laid back. Orri&amp;#039;s drumming in thick socks ...\n\n# - Ooh, it&amp;#039;s the one everyone loves! Byrjun. You sigh on, as we sing along in English.\n\n# - Now everyone&amp;#039;s swapping instruments. Jonsi&amp;#039;s on harmonium, goggi&amp;#039;s on marimba. They play staralfur. They are true masters of the pregnant pause!\n\n# - Aminna, string quartet join for &amp;#039;Heima&amp;#039;. This drawn out tune is the signature of the night. It&amp;#039;s a little bit Philip Glass, a little bit Michael Nyman. Lovely.\n\n# - Now the saddest song Njosnavellin. So much longing is captured in some made up words.\n\n# - The lighting and strings are all much warmer now. Drums played with beaters and a picture behind of a house with white picket fence.\n\n# - Finally, the double bass gets a play!\n\n# - Jonsi has a quiet moment with his acoustic guitar. Pins drop.\n\n# - A sudden end, Goggi puts his shoes back on and they have a stage bow to all the whistling and wooping. Fantastic gig.\n\n47m 08s\n24th October 2007\n\nPre-Order the Heima DVD\n\nEUROPE:\nUSA:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b619a5ab6886a17f01f378ff984cec1e99eb55c6","amp;dn":"Sigur+R%C3%B3s+-+BBC-Electric-Proms+Live+Set+24th+Oct+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b619a5ab6886a17f01f378ff984cec1e99eb55c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,25,165,171,104,134,161,127,1,243,120,255,152,76,236,30,153,235,85,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
