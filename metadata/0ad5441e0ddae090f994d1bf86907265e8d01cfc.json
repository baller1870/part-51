For instance uTorrent shows that there's three(!) seeders on every torrent I upload when they've been published for a few minutes, and I have shared maybe 1% of the file. How's that possible? A month ago it showed &quot;only&quot; two..\n\nThe people who hate what I do block my listening port and slows down my bandwidth to an extreme low, and I'm being bombarded in comments on uploads and mails. The only thing I can do, is to appeal to you who are Christians, to help me seed these torrents, because I don't know how much longer I'm able to do this. Not for long, I fear. And I live in Norway, a so called &quot;free Nation&quot; of the western world..\nAnd then I'm accused of being a &quot;conspiracy-theorist&quot;.. :-)\n\nAnyway: This is Loose Change 2nd Edition with Norwegian hardsubs. I've divided the movie into VERY many, small chapters. That will come in handy when you're trying to keep up with the dialog. American news style.. Go figure..\n\nThe film maker's message is to get the information out there to as many as possible before it's too late. It's nearly too late now.\n\nWe must, dear fellow men and women and Christians especially, prepare ourselves for what is to be forced and lured upon us. We must be prepared. The dam is about to burst, and they pull the plug on life as we know it. Seriously.\n\nTo the Christians (and anybody who wants to really be prepared), I say: Read the Bible more often than ever, praying that you'll be given understanding through His Holy Spirit. And then you'll know what to do until the day of the Lord Jesus comes, when He'll gather all who wait eagerly for His arrival in the sky unto Himself.\n\n&quot;Comfort each other with these words&quot; 1.Thess.4:16-18. You can start there.. :-)\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e39586918a858a91868e828a8fa3848e828a8fcd808c8e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ad5441e0ddae090f994d1bf86907265e8d01cfc","amp;dn":"Loose+Change+2nd+Edition+Norsub+PAL+DVD.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ad5441e0ddae090f994d1bf86907265e8d01cfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,213,68,30,13,218,224,144,249,148,209,191,134,144,114,101,232,208,28,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
