This program will register your CD key for any, or even ALL THREE of these mods so you can play them online with everyone else... and for free!\n\nThen all you need to do is download the mods and install them. Links to legitimate and active .torrent files for EACH mod are included so you do not have to search around for them!\n\nIf a new patch is released, it will most likely clear your cd-key from the Gamespy database so you will not be able to play online (You will get a weird 0x35F3FBBA424110 error when connecting to a server). If this happens, try using the program again, or wait for us to release a new version.\n\n################\n# Greetz       #\n################\n\nThanks to: Eno, Randall, x-Jerm-x, Salty1, Jxhn\nSpecial thanks to: Dice/EA/Gamespy =)\n\nEnjoy this release!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fe357acfba304b71484c6f8d68fbaca8bdd0b91","amp;dn":"Battlefield+2+-+Booster+Pack+Enabler+-+Special+Forces+-+Armored+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fe357acfba304b71484c6f8d68fbaca8bdd0b91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,227,87,172,251,163,4,183,20,132,198,248,214,143,186,202,139,221,11,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
