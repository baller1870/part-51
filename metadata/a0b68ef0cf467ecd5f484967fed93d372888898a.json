It also comes with some nice effects to make still images look realer, and things like that. Personally I think the effects will be corny and just look silly. But anyway, enjoy! :D\n\nNature Illusion Studio lets you transform your digital photos into live and save it as screensavers, executables, AVI, or animated GIF.
