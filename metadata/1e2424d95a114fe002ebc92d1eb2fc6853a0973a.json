Until then, it was unheard of that a murderer would rip out the eyes of a victim, not using any instrument but her bare hands. And that was only the beginning of their violent act. They were charged with other crimes as well, such as incest.\n\nThis is a writerÃƒÂ¢??s insight into the human soul that may serve as a sort of understanding as to why two poor country girls would do such a thing. After all; if they had no-one to turn to but each other, to whom can they show affection but each other? And if you felt weighed down by tasks, loyalty, oppression and fear, what would you do to protect your loved one, and yourself?\n\nThis was a televised BBC + Channel 4 drama aired in the mid nineties. Therefore, as you would expect, drama is intense, but there is not much gory footage, thank goodness (not like that awful flick Haute Tension portraying an insane lesbian murderer IÃƒÂ¢??m sorry to have uploaded). Picture quality is rather poor, even on the original DVD. Even this DivX copy of 700MB is a bit of a waste of bandwidth as it looks smaller.\n\nYou may have seen Joely Richardson in Nip/Tuck and Jodhi May in The Last of the Mohicans, and Julie Walters in Educating Rita and in Calendar Girls.\n\nThere is an intriguing opera based on the same story, The Maids, composed by Peter Bengtson, and probably several books and films. All of France was reported to have been truly shocked by the event in those days. Surely we would be shocked today? I hope so, anyway.\n\nImage:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/jAIomaAbM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/jAIomaAbM&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e2424d95a114fe002ebc92d1eb2fc6853a0973a","amp;dn":"Sister+My+Sister+%28BBC+drama%29+DivX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e2424d95a114fe002ebc92d1eb2fc6853a0973a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,36,36,217,90,17,79,224,2,235,201,45,30,178,252,104,83,160,151,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
