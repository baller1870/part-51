Based upon a story by Jozsef Lengyel, this drama details a few days in the life of a doctor (Zoltan Latinovits). Working in a hospital, he takes leave to go back to the place of his childhood where his father is deathly ill. During his journey and stay at the old farm, he becomes introspective about the importance of friendship and family. Oldas Es Kotes/Cantat is Jancso\\&amp;#039;s earliest work which illustrated his characteristic style of long takes and strong, symbolic imagery. He would go on to make more highly acclaimed films like Szegenylegenyek/The Round Up (1966, also starring Latinovits), Csillagosok, Katanok/The Red and the White (1967) and Meg Ker a Nep/Red Psalm, for which he would win a Best Director award at Cannes Film Festival in 1972.\n\n\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
