Somehow, the image of somber neo-vampires with white face makeup and jet-black hair seems incongruous next to the cheery festivity of the holiday season. (Do they abandon their trademark dark clothing in favor of red-and-green argyle sweaters?) Well, Excelsis, Vol. 2: A Winter&amp;#039;s Song proves you can have your fruitcake and eat it, too. Much like its predecessor, 1995&amp;#039;s A Dark Noel, this album features a selection of holiday songs as interpreted by goth bands. Yet what sounds like a cheesy way to cash in on the Christmas-music craze is actually a pretty good listen, especially if you&amp;#039;re tired of hearing &quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot; for the umpteenth time. Predictably, the songs veer toward the liturgical, but there are also fresh takes on traditional carols and even a Hanukkah song (Sofia Run&amp;#039;s bittersweet take on &quot;Little Candles&quot;--sung in Hebrew, no less). El Duende&amp;#039;s stirring &quot;Gaudete, Gaudete,&quot; Rhea&amp;#039;s Obsession&amp;#039;s Dead Can Dance-like &quot;We Three Kings,&quot; Rasputina member Julia Kent&amp;#039;s beautiful cello rendition of &quot;What Child Is This?,&quot; and Lycia&amp;#039;s eerie &quot;Little Town of Bethlehem&quot; round out a worthwhile collection. Now all you need to do is turn the lights down low, paint the Christmas tree black, and wait for Satan--er, Santa--to come down the chimney.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4c53bb1e89d2b9082b11986dd05f2d9998c64ac","amp;dn":"Excelsis+vol.+2+-+A+Winter%5C%27s+Song+%5B192kbps%2FVBR%2F1999%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4c53bb1e89d2b9082b11986dd05f2d9998c64ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,197,59,177,232,157,43,144,130,177,25,134,221,5,242,217,153,140,100,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
