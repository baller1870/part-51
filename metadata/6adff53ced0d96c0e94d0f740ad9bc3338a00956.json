The first is a nonet which has the same instrumentation as Miles&amp;#039; Birth of the Cool sessions and some of the same players. Gigi wrote all of the tunes with the exception of &quot;The Kerry Dance.&quot; I don&amp;#039;t believe there are very many recordings of his arrangements for a big group, so it is interesting to hear what he can do here. Although it does have a cool sound, it doesn&amp;#039;t sound like the Miles group. Gigi and trumpeter Art Farmer get most of the solo space, though trombonist Jimmy Cleveland has a nice, dreamy solo on &quot;In a Meditating Mood.&quot; Vocalist Ernestine Anderson appears on &quot;Social Call&quot; and &quot;You&amp;#039;ll Always be the One I love,&quot; which adds some variety to an otherwise all instrumental session.\n\nWhile the first session has a cool sound, the second session (last four tracks), featuring Gigi in a quartet setting with Thelonious Monk, has a much harder sound. Other than &quot;Nica&amp;#039;s Tempo&quot; (by Gigi), the tunes are by Monk. (...)&quot;\n\n(Amazon review by J. A.
