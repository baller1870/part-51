Flamenco rhythms, bagpipes and trumpets are just some of the unexpected elements that make an appearance over the course of the album, giving the band a new dimension whilst retaining their raw playing style and unquestionable songwriting skill. Includes the single &amp;#039;Icky Thump.&amp;#039;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b724ea3dfa10620c576658759d065f22b2adeea2","amp;dn":"The+White+Stripes+-+Icky+Thump","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b724ea3dfa10620c576658759d065f22b2adeea2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,36,234,61,250,16,98,12,87,102,88,117,157,6,95,34,178,173,238,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
