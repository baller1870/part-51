Dispatches reporter Antony Barnett meets former Muslims who now live under the threat of reprisals from their former communities. Many are still living in fear. He interviews a family who have been driven out of their home and a convert whose brother was beaten close to death.\n\nThe investigation uncovers a network of churches supporting converts from Islam who have to worship under a veil of secrecy. It is estimated there are as many as 3,000 Muslims who have converted to Christianity living in Britain.\n\nConverting to another religion for a Muslim is not just considered a taboo act by some believers. Certain Islamic texts demand converts - also known as apostates - be punished severely for deserting their faith. In several Islamic states, the death penalty is imposed. Here in Britain, Dispatches discovers a form of mob justice is taking place on our streets. A concerned Christian bishop tells Dispatches that it may not be long before a British convert is killed, and implores Muslim leaders to take action.\n\nDispatches discovers the situation for converts from Islam in Britain is a tinderbox waiting to explode. Increasingly asylum seekers from Islamic countries are exploring different faiths in Britain while a new strand of evangelical Christianity is targeting Britain&amp;#039;s Muslims for conversion.\n\nWith radical British Islamic groups calling for apostates to be executed if they achieved their goal of a worldwide Islamic state, it&amp;#039;s a potentially dangerous cocktail that has been exacerbated by the silence of both Muslim and Christian leaders on the subject.\n\nFile Information: \n\nDVB-T Capture (Freeview) \nXviD 1.1 unpacked bit stream\n672x368\n25fps\n128kbps CBR mp3\n\nScreenshots\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y179/grimerking/Dispatches1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y179/grimerking/Dispatches1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y179/grimerking/Dispatches2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y179/grimerking/Dispatches2.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y179/grimerking/Dispatches3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y179/grimerking/Dispatches3.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c3c1fe75c964407a2731d7a8b84d4b1f9827ed7","amp;dn":"20070917+-+Dispatches+-+Unholy+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c3c1fe75c964407a2731d7a8b84d4b1f9827ed7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,60,31,231,92,150,68,7,162,115,29,122,139,132,212,177,249,130,126,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
