Rating:  1.8 / 5 (based on 3 ratings).\n\nPlot: Incomprehensible action and comedy--for extremists only. \n \nOverview: One night, Police Inspector Chou contacts Alan--leader of the Black Panther Warriors--asking for his help in attempting to steal a box from the Police Department &quot;in order to check their security systems&quot;. Because of the attractive financial reward being offered, Alan takes the job. He quickly assembles a motley crew of 6 Black Panther Warriors, each with wildly different skills and personalities. After some surveillance, they determine that the Police Department in fact does have its weak spots, and they proceed with the plan. However, all hell breaks loose after they commit the deed, when they--duh--realize they were not really hired as security system analysts in the first place... \n\nCast: Alan Tang Kwong-Wing  ||  Brigitte Lin Ching-Hsia  ||  Tony Leung Ka-Fai  ||  Simon Yam Tat-Wah  ||  Carrie Ng Ka-Lai  ||  Jennifer Chan (Ming Chan)  ||  Yuen Wah  ||  Dicky Cheung (Wai Kin)  ||  Elsie Chan (Yik Si)  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.2014/qx/details.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.2014/qx/details.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nP.S.\nSubtitles file for &quot;New Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; available at:\n\n_________________\nDo not break the share chain!
