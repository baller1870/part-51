Outraged and eloquent, the two-time Edgar Award-winner delivers a gut-wrenching portrayal of the storm&amp;#039;s ferocity and devastating aftermath, venting through Robicheaux his frustration at the human incompetence and greed that magnified nature&amp;#039;s destructive fury. His evocative, heartfelt prose, sympathetic characters, and intricately interwoven plotlines grip the reader from the first page. Burke&amp;#039;s admirers will savor this latest installment, while those not yet acquainted with Robicheaux can start here, thanks to the comprehensive background information Burke provides in what critics call his best book yet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cc8b6177203ef5d79688bf66fbac58462364743","amp;dn":"Request%2C+James+Lee+Burke+-+The+Tin+Roof+Blowdown","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cc8b6177203ef5d79688bf66fbac58462364743","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,200,182,23,114,3,239,93,121,104,139,246,111,186,197,132,98,54,71,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
