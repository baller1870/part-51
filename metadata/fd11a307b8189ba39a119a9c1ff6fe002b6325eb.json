The band delivered complex Bluesy prog in a very non-traditional Italian style. They have created its own sound ... an alternation of melody and hard rock, with strong themes (sex, drugs and prostitution. They were also influenced by Ian ANDERSON and JETHRO TULL.\nFirst album arrived in 1972 conceived as an Alvaro FELLA solo album, but the result is not impressive and on a lesser level than their following works. The best one is DNA, (like JETHRO TULL), based on acoustic instruments (guitar, flute, piano) and a great vocals by FELLA. One of the best Italian prog albums for sure! Made with the help of Franco BATTIATO, &quot;Vietato Ai Minori Di 18 Anni?&quot; contains strong lyrics and fragments of avant-garde inspired music. The latest album, &quot;Passing By 1991-2001&quot;, is more new age oriented and mainly instrumental, but containing some very good moments.\n(www.progarchves.com)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd11a307b8189ba39a119a9c1ff6fe002b6325eb","amp;dn":"Jumbo+-+DNA+%281972%2F2004%29+%5BAPE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd11a307b8189ba39a119a9c1ff6fe002b6325eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,17,163,7,184,24,155,163,154,17,154,156,31,246,254,0,43,99,37,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
