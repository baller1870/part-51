You have a new Tomb Raider iso.......peace and have fun. I think if you have a modchip it\nshould boot right up with original image which is 4.37gb. When you are done it should be 3.10gb that is or I mean when done following the instructions. Acquire CdGen 2.0 in the future and learn how to deal with stubborn games like this such as\nTMNT(Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). Burn with Dvd Decrypter or open with Nero and burn. Should boot right up.\n                           Yours Truly,\n\n                                      The Archivist\n\n\n                                      ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94f05445e2751d3a75362793f8b2ca2d3706522b","amp;dn":"Tomb+Raider+Anniversary+Edition+PS2%2FNTSC+quick+kit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94f05445e2751d3a75362793f8b2ca2d3706522b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,240,84,69,226,117,29,58,117,54,39,147,248,178,202,45,55,6,82,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
