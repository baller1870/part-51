Although Erlang has been around for almost ten years now, it became a rather popular programming environment for communication platforms only recently.\n\nThe talk will equip the open-minded programmer with concepts of concurrent programming in a functional programming environment supported by real-world examples.\n\nDespite the fact that actual code fragments will be in display, there is no need for novices and non-programmers to be scared away.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7789497ce587de78196a8fac3b8afac7bb16695","amp;dn":"24c3-2216-de-erlang.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7789497ce587de78196a8fac3b8afac7bb16695","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,120,148,151,206,88,125,231,129,150,168,250,195,184,175,172,123,177,102,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
