As a general rule, the concepts and recommendations for reporting electron beam therapy should be similar to and consistent with those published for photons. However, the dose distributions with electron and photon beams arequite different and may require different approaches as far as beam arrangement, treatment planning and also clinical indications are concerned.\n\nThe report deals mainly with harmonisation in reporting. However, without interfering with the prescription, or with the local policy for recording the treatment parameters, all procedures would be simplified and faster and the risk of confusion and accidents would be reduced if the same definitions of terms and concepts and the same methods for specifying doses and volumes were used for prescribing, recording and reporting the treatments.\n\nAs a general requirement, and as recommended in the other ICRU Reports, the irradiation conditions should be completely reported as well as the time-dose patterns. No weighting factorfor RBE difference (relative to photons) has to be applied for the currently used electron energyrange.\n\n\nwww.icru.org/pubs.htm\nwww.icru.org/pubs_cat.htm#71\njicru.oxfordjournals.org/content/vol4/issue1/index.dtl\n\nMD5SUM: b0fe4dcae0946794bbbb8e89a7d3f928 \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf5f11b743460271533e1248693b72072abd2b25","amp;dn":"ICRU+Report+71.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf5f11b743460271533e1248693b72072abd2b25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,95,17,183,67,70,2,113,83,62,18,72,105,59,114,7,42,189,43,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
