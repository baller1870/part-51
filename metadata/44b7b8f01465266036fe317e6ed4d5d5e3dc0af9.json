She was born and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nOh Susanna (Suzie Ungerleider) returns to her roots here by emphasising her voice and lyrics, and rises to the challenge with graceful ease. That voice really is a marvel, a haunting, expressive instrument that can proudly stand alongside those of Emmylou Harris and Gillian Welch in the roots elite. Sparse and subtle accompaniment comes from her A-list players, including Luke Doucet, David Baxter, Blue Rodeo?s Bazil Donovan and Bob Packwood, Justin Rutledge (who harmonises beautifully on ?Pretty Penny?) and drummer/hubby Cam Giroux. Strings are used judiciously and effectively on ?Miss Liberty? and powerful closer ?Filled With Gold.? Lyrically, Suzie presents a rich, colourful cast of characters, telling their stories with real empathy. There?s the ?beauty queen strapped to a Coke machine? and the teenager who gave up her baby then ran off to ?hang my heart on a hitching post where they got clean air to breathe? on ?Greyhound Bus.? Even Billy The Kid makes an appearance, via her fine cover of Dylan?s ?Billy 4.? This album stresses mood and narrative over melody to stunning effect.\n\nInformaciÃƒÂ³n Disco:\n?
