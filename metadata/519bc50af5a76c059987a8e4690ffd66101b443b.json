There are more than six drivers you can choose from, each with a unique sled that is rated in top speed, acceleration, handling, stability, and tricks. After choosing the appropriate alter ego, use the Practice mode to get a feel for the machine and to learn the bumps and twists of a track. When you are ready for competition, try the Championship mode. In the Open Mountain Championship, the only goal is to get from point A to point B as quickly as possible. If you&amp;#039;re feeling bold, try the Super SnoCross, which calls for you to navigate a course filled with jumps where you score points by performing tricks. When your friends come over, you can get them into the game with a multi-tap. See how much air you can get in SLEDSTORM.\n\n\n\nType.................: Game\n\nPlatform.............: PS1\n\nMore Info............: http://psx.ign.com/objects/011/011637.html\n\nImage Format.........: .bin + .cue\n\nImage Created with...: CloneCD\n\nBurn Tested..........: Yes\n\nPublished by.........: Electronic Arts\n\nDeveloped by.........: EA Canada\n\nGenre................: Racing\n\nNumber of Players....: 1-4\n\nRelease Date.........: August 17, 1999\n\nAlso Available On....: PlayStation 2\n\nFeatures.............: Memory Card, Dual Shock, Vibration \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:519bc50af5a76c059987a8e4690ffd66101b443b","amp;dn":"Sled+Storm-PAL+PS1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"519bc50af5a76c059987a8e4690ffd66101b443b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,155,197,10,245,167,108,5,153,135,168,228,105,15,253,102,16,27,68,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
