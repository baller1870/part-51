E. Lawrence. The film stars Peter O&amp;#039;Toole in the title role. It was directed by David Lean and produced by Sam Spiegel, from a script by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson. It is widely considered one of the greatest and most influential films in the history of filmmaking. The dramatic score by Maurice Jarre, and Super Panavision 70 cinematography by Freddie Young, are also hugely acclaimed.\n\nThe film depicts Lawrence&amp;#039;s experiences in Arabia during World War I, in particular his attacks on Aqaba and Damascus and his involvement in the Arab National Council. Its themes include Lawrence&amp;#039;s emotional struggles with violence in war (especially the conflicts between Arabic tribes and the slaughter of the Turkish army), his personal identity (&quot;Who are you?&quot; is a recurring line throughout the film), and his divided allegiance between his native Britain and its army, and his newfound comrades within the Arabian desert tribes. The film is unusual in having no women in speaking roles.\n\nThis is a DVD-compliant MPEG of the entire, restored epic. The quality is excellent and it is ready to burn to a DVD-9 or a DVD-5 if you don&amp;#039;t mind compression. It is 5.82 gigabytes, so I recommend skipping it if you have a slow connection.\n\nVideo codec: MPEG 2\nAudio codec: MPEG 1, Layer 2, 48000Hz, 224 kb/s, Stereo\nFormat: NTSC, 29.970 fps, Interlaced\nSize: 720 x 480\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: None\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd985dd9b1d5cdd69d97475e509f59fbc1fc0eeb","amp;dn":"Lawrence+of+Arabia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd985dd9b1d5cdd69d97475e509f59fbc1fc0eeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,152,93,217,177,213,205,214,157,151,71,94,80,159,89,251,193,252,14,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
