It can be installed on any ordinary PC or Mac. When these computers \\&quot;sleep\\&quot;, the screen saver comes on and the computers communicate with each other by the internet to share the work of creating morphing abstract animations known as \\&quot;sheep\\&quot;. The result is a collective \\&quot;android dream\\&quot;, an homage to Philip K. Dick\\&amp;#039;s novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.\n\n\nThis is a sheep pack from my computer consisting of 11G sheeps. Download as many as you want, and just put them in the correct folder. For more information see the web page.\n\nI\\&amp;#039;m doing this since I\\&amp;#039;m about to re-install my computer and need some off-site storage for this ;o). Will seed a few days though.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4eb1df557604b52fe3b792043848329029f2480b","amp;dn":"Sheeps+for+electric+sheep+%28screensaver%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4eb1df557604b52fe3b792043848329029f2480b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,177,223,85,118,4,181,47,227,183,146,4,56,72,50,144,41,242,72,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
