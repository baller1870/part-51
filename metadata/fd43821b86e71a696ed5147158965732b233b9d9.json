Green Bay Packers at Seattle Seahawks.\n\nIt was recorded from the live TV feed to an Archos AV380.\n\nThe screen size is 320 x 240, 25 fps, 267kbps 24bit DivX.  The audio is 191kbps MPEG Layer-3.  \n\nThere are 2 AVI video files. The first is all of the 1st half plus some of the 2nd half.  The second file is the rest of the game.\n\nI have left in some of the UK team commentary and all of the US team commentary.  I have tried to remove all of the other NFL game spoilers.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd43821b86e71a696ed5147158965732b233b9d9","amp;dn":"Week_12_MNF_GB_%40_Sea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd43821b86e71a696ed5147158965732b233b9d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,67,130,27,134,231,26,105,110,213,20,113,88,150,87,50,178,51,185,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
