Unlike the Hell-related themes of Doom games, this movie deals with a Resident Evil-like genetic manipulation issue causing the demonic behaviour.\n\nThis release is a high-quality XviD/AC3/Matroska release by me, Junx.  Video is encoded at an average of 987.0 kbps, audio is encoded at a static 448 kbps (straight rip from DVD), and the mkv file contains a chapter list for easy navigation.\n\nIf you are unable to play this movie, check out VLC &lt;http://videolan.org/vlc/&gt;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f631f62fb44cbbc8a5f8443c3d812c03f9c6ce8","amp;dn":"Doom.DVDRip.XviD.AC3.HQ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f631f62fb44cbbc8a5f8443c3d812c03f9c6ce8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,99,31,98,251,68,203,188,138,95,132,67,195,216,18,192,63,156,108,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
