(Bimonthly as in twice a month and not every other month.)\n\nThe first story debuted in 1995, running in issues 7-12. This story introduced the main character Tzusuki Asato. The manga has run on and off through the last three years but has currently accumulated 11 tankobon (collections of the stories printed in the mangazine). The present story arc seems to be dealing with Hisoka&amp;#039;s family, Hisoka getting a (some?) Shikigami, and Tsuzuki&amp;#039;s relations with his 12 Shikigami. \n\n-----------------------------\n\nUploaders note: There is an implied gay love interest in this anime, didn&amp;#039;t worry me but you have been warned.\n\nThis .rar contains all episodes and a fan-art trailer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c96540873dae4dc8dd5cce677f39868a21761a9","amp;dn":"Yami+no+Matsuei.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c96540873dae4dc8dd5cce677f39868a21761a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,150,84,8,115,218,228,220,141,213,204,230,119,243,152,104,162,23,97,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
