Kingston, Jamaica is abuzz with funky reggae sounds, new electronic wah-wah guitar pedals, moog keyboard synthesizers, and tons of funk-dafied reggae experimentation from King Tubby, Lee Perry, Bob Marley, Big Youth, The Skatalites, and the Pioneers.\n\nThis episode takes a trip to Kingston&amp;#039;s early 1970s funky reggae era, with some great reggae covers and versions of funk tunes. In addition, we have lots of home-grown Kingston hits, and a few U.S funksters like the Meters and the Ohio Players crossing over to provide funky reggae-ska-soul-funk versions.  Episode 40 kicks off with &quot;Some Good Old Funky Music&quot; from the Meters, and then hits us from the top like a &quot;Crazy MotherFunky&quot; featuring two duos with Bob Marley and Lee Perry - &quot;Caution&quot; and &quot;Shocks Amighty.&quot;  \n\nThe Funky Reggae era lasted in Kingston from 1968 until 1974. During this time, King Tubby and Lee Perry were the primary producers of funk and reggae crossover music.  In 1973 Bob Marley &amp; The Wailer&amp;#039;s first Island records album &quot;Catch a Fire&quot;  introduced reggae to a broader, global audience.  After 1973, fans outside of Jamaica began their love affair with reggae, creating a new rush of interest and many new artists on Kingston scene. By 1975, &quot;Funky Reggae&quot; had given way to a new trend, the Rockers era (see Dub Session episode 28), heralding roots reggae artists and the new superstar - DJ vocalists and toasters.\n\n\nPLAYLIST\n\n01 Intro - The Funky Meters - Good Old Funky Music\n02 Bob Marley and Lee Perry - Caution and Shocks of Mighty pt. 1\n03 King Tubby &amp; Jacob Miller - City Of The Weak Heart Dub (Mixed by King Tubby)\n04 The Ohio Players - Funky Worm\n05 Cymande - 1972\n06 The Funky Meters - Jambalaya\n07 Lee &amp;#039;Scratch&amp;#039; Perry - Kung Fu - Enter The Dragon - Theme from Hong Kong\n08 Skatalites Meet King Tubby In Dub - Fugitive Dub - Motion Records\n09 The Pioneers - papa was a rolling stone (reggae version)\n10 Get Back - The Beatles (Toots and Maytals Reggae Version)\n11 Lee Perry &amp; The Upsetters - Jungle Lion\n12 Jablonski - Soul Makossa -Out on A Funky Trip - Motion Records\n13 Big Youth - Downtown Kingston Pollution\n14 Version - Paul McCartney - Live and Let Die (reggae version)\n15 Tommy McCook - Bubble Strut - Out On A Funky Trip - Motion Records\n16 Bob_Marley_&amp;_The_Wailers - Kinky Reggae -  Catch_A_Fire (Original_Jamaican_Version)\n17 Power Steppers -  Dub Session Roots Future Bumper\n18 Quincy Jones_Greatest Hits_Sanford &amp; Son Theme The Streetbeater\n19 The Dreads At King Tubby&amp;#039;s (1974 To 1977)- Dr. Alimentado &amp; Jah Stitch-The Barber Feel It\n20 The Funky Meters - Message From The Meters -\n21 Lloyd Charmers &amp; the Hippy Boys - Look-ka-py-py\n22 Bob Marley - Chant Down Babylon Remixes- Roots, Rock, Reggae\n\n\nTHE DUB SESSION PODCAST\nprogressive reggae dub and downtempo grooves &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dubsession.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dubsession.com&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66b24def723306ab4d22f78b0b491038f32b618c","amp;dn":"Dub+Session+reggae+dub+podcast+-+Funky+KiDub+Session+40+-+Funky+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66b24def723306ab4d22f78b0b491038f32b618c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,178,77,239,114,51,6,171,77,34,247,139,11,73,16,56,243,43,97,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
