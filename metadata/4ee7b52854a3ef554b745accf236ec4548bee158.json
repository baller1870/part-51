Best\ndetection, fastest performance &amp; smallest footprint.\n\nComprehensive Protection\nNOD32 is a single, highly optimized engine that works as a\nunified anti-threat system to protect against a broad\nspectrum of malware. Viruses, worms, spyware, and other\nmalicious attacks, which are constantly evolving. Eset\nNOD32 utilizes patent-pending ThreatSense Technology to\ndetect tomorrow&amp;#039;s threats in real-time, by analyzing code\nexecution for malicious intent - keeping you ahead of the\nmalware-writers.\n\nProactive Real-Time Detection\nThe best security is proactive. Malware protection must be\nreal-time at the point of impact. Every minute one waits\nfor a virus signature update creates a window of\nvulnerability that could have devastating consequences.\nEset NOD32&amp;#039;s ThreatSense Technology closes the window of\nvulnerability left open by other reactive, signature-based\nantivirus vendors.\n\nNOD32 analyzes application execution in real-time for\nmalicious intent to detect and block over 90% of new\nmalware threats proactively, without the need for signature\nupdates in most cases. Most other vendors release\nsignatures hours after their customers have been victimized\nand submitted samples. av-comparatives.org.\n\nIntegrated Protection\nViruses, worms, adware, and spyware can and should be\ndetected by a single engine. A well-designed, integrated\napplication like Eset NOD32 can detect adware, spyware,\nviruses, rootkits, and other malicous attacks. Running\nseparate applications for viruses, hackers, adware, and\nspyware can slow your PC, be difficult to manage, and\nprovide questionable protection. Beware of large, bloated\ninternet security suites that consume hundreds of megabytes\non your PC. These typically exist because vendors have\nacquired products and &amp;#039;bundled&amp;#039; them together. In contrast,\nEset NOD32 was designed from the core as a single,\nhighly-optimized engine to stop malware.\n\nProtection against threats from multiple input vectors is\nprovided by the following modules:\n\nAntivirus MONitor (AMON)\nAn on-access (memory-resident) scanner, which automatically\nscans files before they&amp;#039;re accessed.\n\nNOD32\nAn on-demand scanner, which can be run manually on specific\nfiles or disk segments. It can also be scheduled to run\nduring off-peak times.\n\nInternet MONitor (IMON)\nA memory-resident scanner that runs on the Winsock level to\nprevent infected files from reaching the computer&amp;#039;s disks.\nIts scans internet web browsing traffic (HTTP) and incoming\ne-mail via the POP3 protocol.\n\nE-mail MONitor (EMON)\nAn auxiliary module for scanning incoming/outgoing e-mails\nvia the MAPI interface, such as Microsoft Outlook Microsoft\nExchange.\n\nDocument MONitor (DMON)\nUtilizes the proprietary Microsoft API for scanning\nMicrosoft Office documents (including Internet Explorer).\n\nFast Performance\nGreat detection doesn&amp;#039;t have to slow down your computer.\nWritten largely in assembly language, NOD32 continually\nwins awards for the fastest performance of any antivirus\napplication, on average 2 to 5 times faster than the\ncompetition (source: Virus Bulletin). Switch to NOD32 and\nupgrade your computer&amp;#039;s performance.\n\nSmallest Footprint\nNOD32 conserves resources on disk and in memory, leaving\nmore for your critical applications. The installer is just\n8.6 MB and the application takes up less than 20 MB in\nmemory (this fluctuates with changes to the detection\ntechnology). ThreatSense updates, which includes heuristics\nlogic and signatures, are usually between 20 kB and 50 kB.\nSwitch to NOD32 and reclaim precious resources.\n\nEasy to Manage\nProgram and database updates are automaticaly performed\nbehind the scenes. If you&amp;#039;re an individual or home office\nuser you can just &amp;#039;set it and forget it.&amp;#039; Businesses and\norganizations with large distributed networks can use the\npowerful Remote Administrator to centrally deploy, install,\nmonitor and manage thousands of NOD32 workstations and\nservers.\n\nGet the best protection with the smallest footprint and\nfastest performance. NOD32 offers multiple layers of\nprotection for your organization, at the desktop, file\nserver and mail gateway. Find out which solution is best\nfor you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ee7b52854a3ef554b745accf236ec4548bee158","amp;dn":"ESET+NOD32+v2.51.30+WinNT2K2K3XP+Cracked+REPACK-BRD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ee7b52854a3ef554b745accf236ec4548bee158","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,231,181,40,84,163,239,85,75,116,90,204,242,54,236,69,72,190,225,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
