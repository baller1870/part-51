In an event where it doesn&amp;#039;t find a valid FSX installation, the installer quits. This makes it impossible (yet) to use it with FS2004. I don&amp;#039;t have FSX installed, so have seen the installer quit. I am sure it would work with FSX installed.\n\n\n** It would be great (for me and all other FS9 simmers) if somebody on TPB manages to upload the RIP and maybe also include instructions on using it with FS2004. **\n==================================================================================\n\nI have downloaded this file from EMule and take credit only for sharing it on TPB.\n\nAlso, I have a slow internet connection. So please be patient. I would seed for sure. HAPPY LANDINGS TO ALL !!!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cde171b5921d7022b0b9484f3b4e37868944f46f","amp;dn":"FSX+-+FS2004+Shockwave+3D+Lights","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cde171b5921d7022b0b9484f3b4e37868944f46f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,225,113,181,146,29,112,34,176,185,72,79,59,78,55,134,137,68,244,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
