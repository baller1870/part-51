At that time, Linux was already well-known as a powerful and stable operating system that demanded strong technical knowledge and extensive use of the &quot;command line&quot;; MandrakeSoft saw this as an opportunity to integrate the best graphical desktop environments and contribute its own graphical configuration utilities and quickly became famous for setting the standard in ease-of-use and functionality. With this innovative approach, Mandriva Linux offers all the power and stability of Linux to both individuals and professional users in an easy-to-use and pleasant environment. Thousands of new users are discovering Linux each and every day and finding it a complete replacement for their previous operating system. Linux as a server or workstation has no reason to be jealous of any other more established operating systems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48b48c195dee3fd629308676b518da45e3fee0e7","amp;dn":"Mandriva+One+2007+KDE+%286%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48b48c195dee3fd629308676b518da45e3fee0e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,180,140,25,93,238,63,214,41,48,134,118,181,24,218,69,227,254,224,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
