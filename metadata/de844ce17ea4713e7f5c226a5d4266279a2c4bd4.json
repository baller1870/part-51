There&amp;#039;s no substance to this picture, but I don&amp;#039;t think that the film-makers cared about that. No, they just made a picture strictly catered to the young crowd that is really just for straightforward fun. Don&amp;#039;t worry about looking for hidden meanings or symbolism.\n\nDavid and his gang are a cool-looking bunch with two members (Brooke McCarter, Billy Wirth) who look like they could have been part of a rock group and the third guy is played by Alex Winter - a.k.a. &quot;Bill&quot; of &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&quot;.\n\nThe young cast is okay; I would only have real criticisms for Jami Gertz&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;performance&amp;#039;. Wiest, as usual, is excellent, and seasoned performer Edward Herrmann kind of looks out of place but he makes up for it with a typically good performance.\n\nEcho and the Bunnymen do a good cover of the Doors&amp;#039; &quot;People Are Strange&quot; and Roger Daltrey does an equally fine cover of Elton Johns&amp;#039; &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Let The Sun Go Down On Me&quot;.\n\n&quot;The Lost Boys&quot; is fun if never truly scary.\n\n\nSource: NTSC DVD\nRes:  720x304\nCodec: Xvid\nAudio:  5.1 english\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de844ce17ea4713e7f5c226a5d4266279a2c4bd4","amp;dn":"The+Lost+Boys+DVDrip+5.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de844ce17ea4713e7f5c226a5d4266279a2c4bd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,132,76,225,126,164,113,62,127,92,34,106,93,66,102,39,154,44,75,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
