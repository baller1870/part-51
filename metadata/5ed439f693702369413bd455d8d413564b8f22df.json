In 1988, the band won a Grammy \nAward for Best Concept Music Video. Genesis&amp;#039;s members have \nincluded Peter Gabriel, Mike Rutherford, Steve Hackett and \nPhil Collins, all of whom have achieved success as solo \nartists.\n\nGenesis began as a 1960s pop band, playing moody, simple \nguitar-driven melodies. During the 1970s, they evolved into \na progressive rock band, and began to incorporate complex \nsong structures and elaborate instrumentation, while their \nconcerts took on a more theatrical tone. This second phase \nwas characterised by lengthy performances such as the \ntwenty-three minute &quot;Supper&amp;#039;s Ready&quot;, and 1974&amp;#039;s concept \nalbum The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. The 1980s saw the \nband produce more accessible pop music based on melodic \nhooks; this change of direction gave them their first \nnumber one-charting album in the United Kingdom, Duke, \nand their only number one single in the United States, \n&quot;Invisible Touch&quot;.\n\n\nGenesis have changed personnel several times. Collins \n-previously the band&amp;#039;s drummer- replaced Gabriel as \nlead singer in 1975, and was replaced by former Stiltskin \nsinger Ray Wilson for the 1997 album Calling All Stations. \nDue to the commercial failure of that album, the band \nannounced an indefinite hiatus. In October 2006, Collins, \nRutherford and Tony Banks reunited for a world tour\n\n___________________\n_Supplied by LWan _\n___________________\n_________________________________\n_Saker som lagts ut?  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/LWan/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/LWan/&lt;/a&gt;\n_________________________________\n\nTack till alla som seedar vidare ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ed439f693702369413bd455d8d413564b8f22df","amp;dn":"Genesis-Turn_It_On_Again-The_Hits_%28The_Tour_Edition%29-%28Advance%29-2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ed439f693702369413bd455d8d413564b8f22df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,212,57,246,147,112,35,105,65,59,212,85,216,212,19,86,75,143,34,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
