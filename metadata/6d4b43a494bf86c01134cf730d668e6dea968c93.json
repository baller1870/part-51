Was browsing the usual music blogs yesterday, and some of them posted a link to a YouTube-video featuring images from the Daft Punk office. It was quickly removed from the blogs as well as YouTube. Don&amp;#039;t know why, probably because Daft Punk found it. But yeah I got pretty lucky cause (I&amp;#039;m a big fan!) the first thing I did was save it off YouTube using keepvid.com. And since I think it&amp;#039;s a pretty interesting thing that should be released to the public no matter what Daft says, here it is. \n\nMP4-format","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d4b43a494bf86c01134cf730d668e6dea968c93","amp;dn":"EXCLUSIVE+look+inside+the+DAFT+PUNK+office+%28leaked%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d4b43a494bf86c01134cf730d668e6dea968c93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,75,67,164,148,191,134,192,17,52,207,115,13,102,142,109,234,150,140,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
