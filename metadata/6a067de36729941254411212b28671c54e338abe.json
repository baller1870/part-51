During the operation, a wax-coated audio cassette is found in Jigsaw&amp;#039;s stomach. Detective Hoffman is called to the scene, where he plays the tape which states that, although Jigsaw is dead, &quot;the games have just begun.&quot;\nThe scene changes to two men awakening in a mausoleum, finding themselves in one of Jigsaw&amp;#039;s prearranged &quot;games&quot;. One man has been rendered blind (his eyes sewn shut), while the other is mute (his lips sewn together). In a desperate attempt to escape, the mute man kills the panicking blind man, takes a key from the blind man&amp;#039;s neck, and frees himself. He then begins screaming in terror which causes the stitches to tear free and blood pours from his mouth.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a067de36729941254411212b28671c54e338abe","amp;dn":"Saw+4+2007+R5+LiNE+XViD-MERRYXMAS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a067de36729941254411212b28671c54e338abe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,6,125,227,103,41,148,18,84,65,18,18,178,134,113,197,78,51,138,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
