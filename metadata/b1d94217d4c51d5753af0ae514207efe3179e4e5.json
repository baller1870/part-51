He took us down at      |#|\n    |#|  least 15 times for about 10-12 hours at a time and  |#|\n    |#|  answered shit-loads of questions for weeks without  |#|\n    |#|  ever getting annoyed.                               |#|\n    |#|  - Psy made only one requirement: that the movie     |#|\n    |#|  respect a geographical cohesion when showing his    |#|\n    |#|  journey through the Catacombs. Being in the editing |#|\n    |#|  room was like being back in the labyrinth trying to |#|\n    |#|  figure out were the fuck the exit was...            |#|\n    |#|  - To this day, Psy is still working on his castle.  |#|\n    |#|  - Psy publicly showed his paintings about the       |#|\n    |#|  catacombs and shared his part of his life in an     |#|\n    |#|  exhibit entitled &quot;AUTOPSY&quot; in fall 2004.            |#|\n    |#|  - We had one camera for the whole shoot and by the  |#|\n    |#|  end, it was held together with duct tape.           |#|\n    |#|                                                      |#|\n    |#|  Release Notes:..................................... |#|\n    |#|                                                      |#|\n    |#|  Enjoy this nice documentary!                        |#|\n    |#|                                                      |#|\n    |#|                                                      |#|\n    |#|  Watch out for more nice videos &amp; books real soon.   |#|             X\n    |#|  Stay tuned and greets to all our friends!           |#|           ,XXX\n    |#|                                                      |#|XXXXXXXXXXXXXX~\n    &amp;#039;#|  AEROHOLiCS - Reclaim&amp;#039; the streets 2007!             |#&amp;#039;            XX\n    |#|_______________________________X_____________________;|.
