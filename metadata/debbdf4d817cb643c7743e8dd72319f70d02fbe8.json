They have a fresh and crazy sound quite of their own but still with influences from Bob Hund, The Animal Five, Modest Mouse and The Flaming Lips.\n\nThe videobudget was 57 kr (about 8 USD) and of course you can see that. Still the video is cheap and simple, its really appealing and enjoyable.\n\nIf you like rock, pop and surf music you should be a big fan of Sansui Rocknroll.\n\nCheck out their website:\n\nwww.sansuirocknroll.com\n\nand support their myspace:\n\n\nThe album is available on iTunes but Ive got a secret mail from one of the bandmembers who told me this:\n\n-- Sure we sell the album on gigs and on iTunes but our biggest exposure will come when we make the album available on Piratebay.\n\nSo hold on, it looks like we will get the album soon!!!\n\n\nSupport thoose guys, they are really good and cool!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:debbdf4d817cb643c7743e8dd72319f70d02fbe8","amp;dn":"Sansui+Rocknroll+-+Latest+Video","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"debbdf4d817cb643c7743e8dd72319f70d02fbe8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,187,223,77,129,124,182,67,199,116,62,141,215,35,25,247,13,2,251,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
