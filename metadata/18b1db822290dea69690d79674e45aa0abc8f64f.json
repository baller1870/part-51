Failing to read the fine print in his scholarship conditions, he finds he has no choice but to move to the remote and somewhat eccentric town of Cicely, in the wilds of Alaska. Once there, he is welcomed by the peculiar locals who are not keen to see him go, most especially Maurice Minnifield, the ex-NASA astronaut. Despite Joel&amp;#039;s adamant denials, one gets the impression that he enjoys life in Cicely more than he admits.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18b1db822290dea69690d79674e45aa0abc8f64f","amp;dn":"Northern+Exposure+Season+2+DVD+1+%28of2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18b1db822290dea69690d79674e45aa0abc8f64f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,177,219,130,34,144,222,166,150,144,215,150,116,228,90,160,171,200,246,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
