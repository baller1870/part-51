I only put English, because there is no option to choose \\&quot;FARSI\\&quot;.\n\nThis is one of the most probably one of the most popular comedies in Iran for this year, and it is not hard to guess why. It is funny in a very likable and charming way. By the way, non-Iranians, this is the kind of movie you won\\\\\\&amp;#039;t find in any festivals, because there is no subtle meaning. Its all pure, cliched fun. If you are interested in what the average Iranian watches, then get this.\n\nPlot is basically about an Iranian girl and an American guy falling in love. The Iranian girl has a very traditional father, so this, obviously, creates problems.\n\nSubtitles included.\n\nBy the way, please visit and contribute to IranianTorrents.com.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0afec22ca17f50be995fc9d3405838393319e218","amp;dn":"Marriage+Iranian+Style","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0afec22ca17f50be995fc9d3405838393319e218","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,254,194,44,161,127,80,190,153,95,201,211,64,88,56,57,51,25,226,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
