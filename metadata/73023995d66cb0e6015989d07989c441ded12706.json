Dirt broke and attempting to protect their own lives, the duo foolishly dress as women, and manage to join an all-girl orchestra en route to Miami beach in Florida, and luckily for them all of their expenses are paid for. En route to Florida, they share living arrangements with other members of the group - all female - which is especially pleasurable considering the appearance of lead vocalist, a lovely blonde named Sugar (Marilyn Monroe&amp;#039;s best, most legend-affirming performance). The obvious complications ensue, with Joe falling in love with Sugar and using another fake identity - a Cary Grant-esque playboy yachtsman. Jerry&amp;#039;s feminist charade is also having trouble, with millionaire Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown) determined to woe his female fabrication, not knowing Jerry is really a man! To make matters worse, the mob is on the pair&amp;#039;s tale after finding out their witnessing of the murderous events. \n\nRegion: 0\n\nSoundtracks:\nEnglish 5.1\nGerman 5.1\nSpanish 5.1\n\n\nSubtitles:\nEnglish\nGerman\nSpanish\nGerman For Hearing Impaired\n\nSpecial Features:\nVirtual Hall of Memories\nOriginal Theatrical Trailer\nTrailers For Other Billy Wilder Movies\nOriginal Press Book Gallery\n\n\nSorry upload 30KB\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73023995d66cb0e6015989d07989c441ded12706","amp;dn":"Some+like+it+home","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73023995d66cb0e6015989d07989c441ded12706","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,2,57,149,214,108,176,230,1,89,137,208,121,137,196,65,222,209,39,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
