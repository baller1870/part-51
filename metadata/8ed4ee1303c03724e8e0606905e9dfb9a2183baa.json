This leaves the (other) animals topside, to rule the Earth once again. The scientists select James Cole, an imprisoned sociopath, to return to the past and gather information useful in the defense against this contagion. Once back in time, he is to investigate the mysterious &amp;#039;Army of the Twelve Monkeys&amp;#039; and report his findings. Scientific, social, and political themes like time travel (and its inherent paradoxes and nested loops), mental illness, the nature of reality, animal rights, and the Armageddon-potential of unchecked technological advances are artfully and cleverly explored.\n\n\nIMDB link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114746/\n\nDon&amp;#039;t forget to visit us at www.sharego.net !\n\nTotal file size: 2.8 Gb\n\nTracker URL: http://www.sharego.net:2710/announce\n\nAVInaptic Report:\n\n[ About file ]\n\nName: 12 Monkeys.mkv\nDate: 1/01/2008 16:13:28\nSize: 3,009,913,087 bytes (2870.477 MB)\n\n[ Generic infos ]\n\nPlay duration: 02:09:40 (7780.182 s)\nContainer type: matroska\nCreation time: 1/01/2008 21:07:29 UTC\nNumber of streams: 7\nType of stream nr. 1: video (V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC)\nType of stream nr. 2: audio (A_AC3) {Main}\nType of stream nr. 3: audio (A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)) {Commentary}\nType of stream nr. 4: audio (A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)) {French}\nType of stream nr. 5: subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {English Subtitles}\nType of stream nr. 6: subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {French Subtitles}\nType of stream nr. 7: subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {Spanish Subtitles}\nAudio streams: 3\nMuxing Application: libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\nWriting Application: mkvmerge v2.1.0 (&amp;#039;Another Place To Fall&amp;#039;) built on Aug 19 2007 13:40:07\n\n[ Relevant data ]\n\nResolution: 1280 x 688\nWidth: multiple of 32\nHeight: multiple of 16\n\n[ Video track ]\n\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nResolution: 1280 x 688\nFrame aspect ratio: 80:43 = 1.860465 (~1.85:1)\nPixel aspect ratio: 1:1 = 1\nDisplay aspect ratio: 80:43 = 1.860465 (~1.85:1)\nFramerate: 23.975985 fps\n\n[ Audio track nr. 1 ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AC3\nChannels (container): 6\nSample rate: 48000 Hz\nMode: 3 front, 2 rear, 1 LFE\n\n[ Audio track nr. 2 ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)\nSample rate: 24000 Hz\nOutput sample rate: 48000 Hz\n\n[ Audio track nr. 3 ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)\nSample rate: 24000 Hz\nOutput sample rate: 48000 Hz\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ed4ee1303c03724e8e0606905e9dfb9a2183baa","amp;dn":"12+Monkeys+HD+720p+SeCtIoN8+%7BSharegoRG%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ed4ee1303c03724e8e0606905e9dfb9a2183baa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,212,238,19,3,192,55,36,232,224,96,105,5,233,223,185,162,24,59,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
