His self-stated goal was to &quot;completely\nredesign government.\n\nHow To Buy An Election details Tom DeLay&amp;#039;s Stolen Congress and the\nstory of how he did just that. It&amp;#039;s the story of one of the most\nblatant power grabs in American history, and how a District\nAttorney in Texas turned out to be the biggest threat to the\nnational DeLay Machine.\n\nThe film is a warning about how easy it is for American democracy\nto be hijacked by a combination of relentless ambition and\ncorporate millions. It makes the case that DeLay built a\n&quot;custom-made Congress&quot; that is still providing votes for his agenda.\n\nTexas grand juries have brought 41 indictments against eight\ncorporations, DeLay&amp;#039;s political action committee, a business lobby\nally, three underlings and Tom Delay himself. But while Delay has\ngiven up his leadership post, his Texas takeover is still impacting\nall Americans daily. His Texas redistricting changed the face of the\nlast Congress. The Central American Free Trade Agreement, the Energy\nBill, Budgets and Budget Cuts that hurt college students, single\nparents and the working poor - all passed in the last 14 months by\nless than the five votes DeLay won from his scheme in Texas.\n\n____________________________________________________________Encoding__\n\nFile Name....: Tom Delay - How To Buy An Election (2006-TVRip-d0x).avi\nFile Size....: 349 MB (or 358,300 KB or 366,899,200 bytes)\nFrames.......: 544x304 (1.79:1) [=34:19] @ 0.193 bits/pixel\nVideo Codec..: XviD @ 799 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: MP3 @ 128 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) CBR\n_________________________________________________________________d0x__","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc084cef2d9fbc5dbfa268a4d451009a34fadf18","amp;dn":"Tom+Delay+-+How+To+Buy+An+Election","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc084cef2d9fbc5dbfa268a4d451009a34fadf18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,8,76,239,45,159,188,93,191,162,104,164,212,81,0,154,52,250,223,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
