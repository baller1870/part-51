This one serves up a nice mixture of blues covers and originals, with the first side devoted to studio cuts and the second a live club date recording. Certainly the standout track, indeed a signature song by the band, is the tour de force &quot;Train to Nowhere,&quot; with its patient, insistent buildup and pounding train-whistle climax. Additionally, David Anstey&amp;#039;s detailed, imaginative sleeve art further boosts this a notch above most other British blues efforts.\n\nI&amp;#039;ve included cover art &amp; will seed as long as possible depending on laptop storage space :-)\n\nplease seed as long as possible so others can enjoy this also\n\ncheers Gazzjazz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f24007851d18c6220dea5608dc12090c4c54b5b","amp;dn":"Savoy+Brown+%7E+Blue+Matter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f24007851d18c6220dea5608dc12090c4c54b5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,36,0,120,81,209,140,98,32,222,165,96,141,193,32,144,196,197,75,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
