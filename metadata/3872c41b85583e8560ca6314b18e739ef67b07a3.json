This disturbing program, supported by footage including a skinhead hate party and anti-immigrant violence, traces the virulent resurgence of xenophobia in Europe. Joerg Haider, of Austria?s Freedom Party; Albert Szabo, founder of Hungary?s World Nation Party; and politicos from the German, Italian, and French extreme right defend their platforms while author Michael Ignatieff, historian Anton Pelinka, Jewish leaders, and Kosovar and Kurdish refugees counter with insights into the psychology of hate and voice fears that Europe?s bloody history will soon repeat itself.\n\n\nRelease: Fascism.The.Legacy.Of.Hate.PDTV.XViD-Ballerina\nReleasedate: 11 Sep 2007\nGenre: Documentary\nURL: http://www.films.com/\nRes: 512x384\nFps: 29.97\n\nThe cropping goes off in the last few minutes of the show.
