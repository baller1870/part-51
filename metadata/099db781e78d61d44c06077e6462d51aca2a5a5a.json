Her critique is presented as voiceover and an assemblage of print media?articles on subjects ranging from human rights to unemployment and global economics. Implicating the U.S. government and American businesses for supporting regimes that systematically use torture, she indicts the American press for its role as an agent of disinformation through selective coverage, its use of language, and for implicitly legitimizing points of view that support torture.\n\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
