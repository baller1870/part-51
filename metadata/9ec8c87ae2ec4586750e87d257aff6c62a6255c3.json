Battling an upsurge of violence, understaffing of police forces and a lack of crime labs and other facilities, the cops who remain in the New Orleans Police Department have courage to burn and a passion to reclaim and rebuild their city. Rounding out the crew are wisecracking Jeff &quot;Glue Boy&quot; Gooden, the team&amp;#039;s comic relief; tough-as-nails Ginger &quot;Love Tap&quot; LeBeau, the only female on the squad; and Captain James Embry, who wrangles the eclectic personalities of his squad with equal parts humor and tenacity. Through its no-holds-barred crime stories and dramatic personal stories, this intriguing story takes viewers from the Victorian mansions of the Garden District to the rubble of the Lower 9th Ward.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ec8c87ae2ec4586750e87d257aff6c62a6255c3","amp;dn":"K+Ville+Season+1+Episode+1+DVD+FORMAT++%5BJew+Crew%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ec8c87ae2ec4586750e87d257aff6c62a6255c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,200,200,122,226,236,69,134,117,14,135,210,87,175,246,198,42,98,85,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
