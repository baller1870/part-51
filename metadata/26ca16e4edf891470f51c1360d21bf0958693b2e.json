His music takes the genre to a whole other level. \n\n\nAll Covers Included With This Release.\nEnjoy! :-)\n\n\nDont Forget To Seed!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26ca16e4edf891470f51c1360d21bf0958693b2e","amp;dn":"Blak+Genius+-+The+Prophecy+-+2006+-+DuRRTY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26ca16e4edf891470f51c1360d21bf0958693b2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,202,22,228,237,248,145,71,15,81,193,54,13,33,191,9,88,105,59,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
