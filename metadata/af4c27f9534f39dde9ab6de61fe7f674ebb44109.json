After failing twice, SkyNet sends their most advanced machine to date, the T-X or Terminatrix, to not only kill John, but his future wife as well. Once again, a Terminator is sent to protect John and his future wife, and has a small upgrade which allows it to mimick humans more. Not knowing how these terminators were sent, considering he thought he destroyed SkyNet, John will soon learn something that will change his life...forever.\n\n\nExtras:\n- Disc 1:\n  - Trailer PC-Game: T3.\n  - Trailer Videogame: T3.\n  - Cinematic Trailers: Bad Boys 2, Charlie&amp;#039;s Angels 2, The Returner, SWAT.\n  - Teaser: T3.\n  - Mini Documentary: Arnold introduces the movie.\n  - The Movie: T3.\n  - Comments from the actors and director.\n- Disc 2:\n  - Mini Documentary: Storyboards, Puppets in action, The making of the game T3, T3 Documentary, Dressed to kill.\n  - Visual Effects Lab: Introduction, Airlift scene, TX Transformation, Future warfare, Crystal Peak, Create your own visual effects, Battle scenes order, Submerged scenes order, CRS Lab, Cyberdyne Research.\n  - Skynet Database: Surprises, Filmbiographies, Weapons, Actor profiles.\n  - Deleted Scenes.\n  - Terminal Bloops.\n  - Photo Gallery: Terminator Timeline","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af4c27f9534f39dde9ab6de61fe7f674ebb44109","amp;dn":"Terminator+3%3A+Rise+of+the+Machines+%282003%29+PAL+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af4c27f9534f39dde9ab6de61fe7f674ebb44109","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,76,39,249,83,79,57,221,233,171,109,230,31,231,246,116,235,180,65,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
