So I started making my 1hour and a half music experience.\nI like various kinds of music and like to hear them intermixed. That is a risk no radio station takes and also not many djs in the world. \nTill now only Paul Oakenfold , Daniel Davoli and a few more \nhave managed to marry many kinds and ages of music together.\n\nAnyways, hope you enjoy this mixed disks as much as I do.\nRemember that I am not professional, I do this as a hobby.\nThe date after MIXAMIX is the date I have started creating each of this cds. \nThe creation may take from just one day to many months.\n\nA few words about MIXAMIX 20061007\n\nOk Lads and Geds,\n  Here you have my latest mix. I am working on this the last 2 months \n  Since I was somewhat busy with many other things except music I felt\n  the need for some trippy music with an 80s essence in it \n  So here it it 80s , trippy sounds , breaks and eurotrance\n  all together as usual.
