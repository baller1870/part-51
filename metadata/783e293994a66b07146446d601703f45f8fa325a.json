Like their second album &amp;#039;An Island of Joy (In a Sea of Electronic Dreams)&amp;#039; this one also gets its musical inspiration from the works of the French composer Claude Debussy, and the themes of water are again strongly present in the cinematic and impressionistic soundworlds of these long ambient tracks. The original piano works that inspired these tracks are: Reflets dans l&amp;#039;eau (Reflections on Water), Mouvement (Movement in Stillness) and La CathÃƒÂ©drale Engloutie (Echoes from an Engulfed Cathedral). The idea of golden ratio is one of the special spices of this album, expressed in various harmonic and structural aspects of the music. The title track also reflects the ideas of sound architecture - in the long meditative section of the track the listener is taken inside a cathedral built from the sound, the deep gong pillars of the building laid out to follow Pythagorean numeric relations. Each track is an aural adventure on its own so put the stereo on, relax and let the journey begin.\n\n\nTrack listing:\n\n01   Reflections on Water\t\t\t22:56\n02   Movement in Stillness\t\t\t13:32\n03   Echoes from an Engulfed Cathedral\t\t28:50\n\n       total duration\t\t\t\t65:18\n\n\nMore info: \n\nMusictrade website: http://www.musictrade.info\nMusictrade&amp;#039;s Internet Archive pages: http://www.archive.org/details/mt\n\nPrevious Musictrade releases on Pirate Bay:\n\nMT010flac 24 bit http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3593336/\nMT010 http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3591681/\nMT009flac 24bit http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3517105/\nMT009 http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3547435/\nMT008flac 24bit http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3517092/\nMT008 http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3517092/\nMT007 http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3459597/\nMT006 http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3425437/\nMT005 http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3409502/\nMT004 http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3405718/\nMT003 http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3376551/\nMT002 http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3405718/\nMT001 http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3519855/\n\n\nEnjoy,\n\nMusictrade","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:783e293994a66b07146446d601703f45f8fa325a","amp;dn":"Doc%26Lena+S+-+Echoes+from+an+Engulfed+Cathedral+%5Bambient%2CMT011%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"783e293994a66b07146446d601703f45f8fa325a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,62,41,57,148,166,107,7,20,100,70,214,1,112,63,69,248,250,50,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
