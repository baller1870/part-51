Everybody is encouraged to create VFP torrents and start sharing rare vinyl records. \n\nThe twentieth century saw a vast body of music released on vinyl, which was never re-released in a digital format, especially works within the art music genres (classical, avant-garde, experimental, electronic, contemporary, jazz, blues, folk, world, ethnic, marginal progressive rock, early recordings, 78s, wax cylinders and other rarities.)  These records are in danger of being extinct, along with their historical and educational values.  \n\nThe amount of work required to digitize all music is enormous and only an internetwide collaborative effort can save these rarities from extinction.  So start contributing today.  Digitize your rare records before they go bad.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6da2c42d43d9cd06a9881ac4518029fb6e1f5622","amp;dn":"Vinyl+Flac+Project+%28+VFP%29+Luciano+Berio+Sincronie%2C+Ezra+Laderman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6da2c42d43d9cd06a9881ac4518029fb6e1f5622","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,162,196,45,67,217,205,6,169,136,26,196,81,128,41,251,110,31,86,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
