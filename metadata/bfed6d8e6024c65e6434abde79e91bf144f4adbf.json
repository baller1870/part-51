It improves graphics and gives control over the speed of the Dos Emulation, by way of CPU Cycles and Frameskip. These features are not part of the standard DosBox, at least not the version I have here. \n\nI have tested this with old games such as Syndicate and Master of Magic.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfed6d8e6024c65e6434abde79e91bf144f4adbf","amp;dn":"DosBox+0.65+%5BTweaked%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfed6d8e6024c65e6434abde79e91bf144f4adbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,237,109,142,96,36,198,94,100,52,171,222,121,233,27,241,68,244,173,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
