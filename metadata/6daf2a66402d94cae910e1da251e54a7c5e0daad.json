Someone else let you have the file, so just give\nback.\n\nYou can upload the .TORRENT on other publics/privates tracker\nMore trackers = more seeders/leechers = more speed overall :D\nI don&amp;#039;t know all of them ;) But keep all the files and \nuse the .TXT for description.\n\n\nThank&amp;#039;s\n\n******************************************************\nNEW: INFO 2 MIS v2.0.0B4 is out!!!! 2006-10-11\n\nWhat&amp;#039;s new:  Create a .MIS from IMDB within Windows Explorer \nand a few other things. I got a small video taken from\nthe M.I.S. site (249KB) that show you how. It could not \nbe more easier than that now!\n\n******************************************************\nIf you download a free file anywhere(database/software)\nremember to click on the ads. They do appreciated it. \nIt pays for the bandwidth/site! :D\n\n******************************************************\nSo, what is a .MIS(my own definition)? \n\nA .MIS is a metadata text file(title, description, \ncredit, goofs, chapters...) file formatted to help \nin the organization of all the movies/tv shows/podcast ...\nyou got in folders. It replace the .NFO.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s formated so that players (software and consumer \nelectronics) can use that information(metadata) and\ndisplay it on the screen.\n\nThe .TXT was made from the .MIS text file as the source. \nI only created it to post on sites. Otherwise, I don&amp;#039;t \nuse it.\n\n******************************************************\n\nINFO 2 MIS v2.0.0B4 is free. It&amp;#039;s the app&amp;#039;s that I \nused to create the .MIS. It can also extract\ninformation from imdb.com(with picture), tv.com, \namazon.com(with picture), dvdempire.com (with picture) ....\n\nTook me a second with an episode on tv.com and\na few more for a movies on imdb.com\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mcgrathinfosolution.com/info2mis_en.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mcgrathinfosolution.com/info2mis_en.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n******************************************************\n\nMIS Info Video Basic v2.3.0 is free(no nag)\nand \nMIS Info Video v2.3.0(30 day trial still work after but lose\nparental control, resume playback...and free upgrades\n\nIf you don&amp;#039;t like the internal player, you can configure your\nplayer.
