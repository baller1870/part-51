In these stories, life was often celebrated through the study of the character of the human heart.\n\nIn THE YOUNG LIONS, we experience masterful story writing in the screenplay by a man named Edward Anhalt who adapted it from a novel by Irwin Shaw. In this fine example of the final years of the Golden Age of Hollywood we see a study of character, ideas and humanity seen amidst the greatest conflict this Earth has ever known, WWII.\n\nVideo: PAL\n\nAspect Ratio:2.35:1 , 16:9\n\nSource: Dvd9 \n\nVideo: Untouched \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d52fd26751fad959d7c5e34ab3b4ac273e1c5f3","amp;dn":"The+Young+Lions%281958%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d52fd26751fad959d7c5e34ab3b4ac273e1c5f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,82,253,38,117,31,173,149,157,124,94,52,171,59,74,194,115,225,197,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
