Because I have enjoyed downloads in the past, I wanted to give back to the community.  It took me a while to get an account here because I wasn&amp;#039;t getting the confirmation email.\n\nThere are two kinds of video downloaders: Those who just want to get it quick, watch it, and then dump it, and those who want the full viewing experience or want to burn it to DVD-R and keep it.  Both are valuable contributions.  My files are for the latter type.  These files are large, many are DVD9, and I am not removing anything from the original disc. They are created using CloneDVD2 and burned in ISO image format.\n\nFILM TITLE: 12 Monkeys\n\nDVD TITLE: 12_MONKEYS\n\nMOVIE YEAR: 1995 Universal City Studios, Inc.\n\nDVD RELEASE YEAR: 1999\n\nREGION: Region 1\n\nTV Format: NTSC\n\nSCREEN FORMAT: 1.85:1 Anamorphic Widescreen\n\nLANGUAGE: English\n\nAUDIO: DTS 5.1, Dolby Surround\n\nDual Layer DVD\n\nColor\n\nRATING: R\n\nRUNNING TIME: 2 Hours 10 Minutes\n\nDIRECTOR: Terry Gilliam\n\nSTARRING: Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe, Brad Pitt\n\n\nOVERVIEW:\n\n\nA lone time traveler from the year 2035 must solve a riddle that may save his people...but it may take him to the brink of madness.

Along the way, he crosses paths with a beautiful psychiatrist (Stowe) and a one-card-short-of-a-full-deck mental patient (Pitt).
