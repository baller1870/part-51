Just burn the ISO to a DVD.\n\nThis is a counter-video of the famous &quot;Loose Change 2nd Edition&quot;. Using their own video and words, &quot;Screw Loose Change&quot; debunks the theories and statements made in Loose Change 2nd Edition. This new edition features urls to sources, less bitching, and longer rebuttals. NOTE: I apologize for some areas of the film having poor grammar and spelling. I did not proof read this as I wanted this displayed before 9/11/06. You can read a written document of mine, &quot;Frequetly Stupid Theories&quot;, that cites the same sources and goes into a greater description of the claims made in Loose Change and other 9/11 theories.
