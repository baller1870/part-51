Later, as an adult human who happened to be raised by elves, Santa allows him to go to New York City to find his birth father, Walter Hobbs (James Caan). Hobbs, on Santa&amp;#039;s naughty list for being a heartless jerk, had no idea that Buddy was even born. Buddy, meanwhile, experiences the delights of New York City (and human culture) as only an elf can. When Walter&amp;#039;s relationship with Buddy interferes with his job, he is forced to reevaluate his priorities.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fcf84d49ec0bfb33c1ac51023d7b0f683130f99","amp;dn":"Elf.DVDRip.SWESUB-Steffmeister.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fcf84d49ec0bfb33c1ac51023d7b0f683130f99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,207,132,212,158,192,191,179,60,26,197,16,35,215,176,246,131,19,15,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
