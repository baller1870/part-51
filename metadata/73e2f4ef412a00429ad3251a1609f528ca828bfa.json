One is uptight and by-the-book, the butt of hazing by other officers; he runs through a dozen partners in two years. The other steals from bookies and hangs out with low-lifes. Bad-guy Reese Feldman is importing an odorless, tasteless cocaine that fools drug-sniffing dogs. One of his murder victims washes up on shore about the time Hutch&amp;#039;s informants tell him a big cocaine deal is going down. But, our fearless duo moves too quickly, and they are suspended from the force; the partnership founders amid bad feeling. Can they patch it up, don disguises, and ferret out where the murderer hid the coke? \n\nNTSC - WideScreen (16x9) - Region 4 Retail \nSize: 4,32 GB (*.iso) \nAudio: English DD 5.1 &amp; PortuguÃƒÂªs(BR) 5.1 \nSubtitles: English, EspaÃƒÂ±ol &amp; PortuguÃƒÂªs (BR) \nMenu: English \nExtras: Yes \nEncoding Info: \n- Reduction Level for DVD-5: 74,6% \n- Overall Bitrate : 4.495/3.596Kbs \n- Space for Video : 3.522.256KB \n- HIGH/LOW/TYPICAL Bitrates: 5.011/1.178/3.596 Kbs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73e2f4ef412a00429ad3251a1609f528ca828bfa","amp;dn":"Starsky+%26+Hutch+%282004%29+%2ANTSC%2A+Audio%3A+Eng+%26+Port%28BR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73e2f4ef412a00429ad3251a1609f528ca828bfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,226,244,239,65,42,0,66,154,211,37,26,22,9,245,40,202,130,139,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
