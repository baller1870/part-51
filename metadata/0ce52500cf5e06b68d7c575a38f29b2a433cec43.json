From the fringes of the galaxy to our own backyards, the UFO FILES searches for evidence of life beyond our world. Tracing the long, convoluted history of UFO encounters and research, this unique series opens new windows into the controversial field.\n\nSince the 1960s, thousands of UFO landings, flyovers and collisions have left scientific evidence behind for study. These events have become known in the field of UFOlogy as the &quot;Trace Cases.&quot; There are over 3,000 documented UFO physical Trace Cases and they have occurred in over 90 countries around the world. From impressions in the dirt, burned or broken vegetation and trees to scientific abnormalities that have yet to be explained, Trace Cases offer up some of the most convincing evidence of the UFO reality. \n\nThe facts are mounting, and this comprehensive survey offers the best look yet at what could possibly be evidence of Alien Encounters. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ce52500cf5e06b68d7c575a38f29b2a433cec43","amp;dn":"%5BHistory+Channel%5D+UFO+Files+-+Alien+Encounters.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ce52500cf5e06b68d7c575a38f29b2a433cec43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,229,37,0,207,94,6,182,141,124,87,90,56,242,155,42,67,60,236,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
