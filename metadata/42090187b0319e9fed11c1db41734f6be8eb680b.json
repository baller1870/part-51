My plans were to shoot the whole\nset with my camera, but I fucked up so I only got &quot;Within You&quot; =/ better than\nnothing I guess...\n\nGreat performance btw. Afterward it was time for signing records and stuff.\nI got their latest album &quot;Karmacode&quot; signed and a promo poster.\nLast the whole band gathered for a photoshoot where everyone could take photos.\n\nWhen it was over and most fans left the store I took the opportunity to pose\nand take pictures with the band members, hehe...but I don&amp;#039;t include them here\nfor obvious reasons.\n\nLater the same evening it was time for the concert at TrÃƒÂ¤dgÃƒÂ¥rn. Support were\nGothminister (awesome goth-industrial metal) and another band which name I\ndon&amp;#039;t remember since they were cancelled.\n\nThe performance of Lacuna Coil were great anyway, lots of energy. Cristina\nhave a really good connection to the audience, so you can tell they appreciate\ntheir fans!\n\nwhen they were done they threw out a bunch of guitar picks, and drumsticks.\nUnfortuneatly I didn&amp;#039;t catch anything, I only got a unopened waterbottle from\nAndrea, haha :P\n\nAnyway, this is my story from this day. Now enjoy the clips!\n\nYeah, almost forgot...I used a Konica Minolta Dimage X60. The damn thing\nrecords to huge Quicktime files, so the clips are converted to MP4 to\nreduce size, even if quality suffers a little.\n\nCheers // AssMaster\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42090187b0319e9fed11c1db41734f6be8eb680b","amp;dn":"Lacuna+Coil+-+Live+at+Tradgarn%2C+Gothenburg+20061029","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42090187b0319e9fed11c1db41734f6be8eb680b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,9,1,135,176,49,158,159,237,17,193,219,65,115,79,107,232,235,104,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
