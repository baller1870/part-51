He and his team of medical doctors try to cure very ill ordinary people in the United States of America.\n\n\n--- The episode --------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA nun arrives at the clinic with what appears to be a skin rash caused by an allergy, and starts to go into anaphylactic shock in reaction to the medication Dr. House gives her. When he then gives her an injection of epinephrine, she goes into cardiac arrest, leading Dr. Cuddy to assume that House gave her an accidental overdose. Absolutely sure that he gave the patient the correct dosage, House begins a series of unorthodox treatments to uncover the truth, and also does a bit of snooping into the sister&amp;#039;s past.\n\n\n--- info ---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\naudio codec: MPEG-1 Layer 3, 48000Hz  139 kb/s tot , Stereo LAME3.92\n\ncideo codec: XviD 1.0.2\n\nresolution: 640 x 352 pix\n\nsize: 350 MB (or 359,382 KB or 368,007,168 bytes)\n\nIMDb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0606018/\n\nOriginal Air Date: 14 December 2004 (Season 1, Episode 5)\n\n\n--- Why this torrent? -------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst of all, I didn&amp;#039;t make this file but I downloaded it from someone else. \nBut with a lot of TV series and movies on this site (and others) it was zipped or \nrarred and like most of you I find that very annoying. \nSo I made this torrent with the unzipped content and uploaded it here.\n\nThere will probably be more....\n\n\n__Razer__\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88efa215c74c19533e7507e4128fdb57346bcd66","amp;dn":"House+MD+-+105+-+Damned+If+You+Do.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88efa215c74c19533e7507e4128fdb57346bcd66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,239,162,21,199,76,25,83,62,117,7,228,18,143,219,87,52,107,205,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
