In many ways Hubble is the most successful scientific project in the World, and this event is not likely to go unnoticed. The European Space Agency, ESA, has decided to celebrate this anniversary with the production of a Hubble 15th Anniversary movie called Hubble - 15 Years Of Discovery. The movie covers all aspects of the Hubble Space Telescope project: a journey through the history, the trouble and the scientific successes of Hubble.\n\nThis portrait of one of the biggest scientific projects of all time contains large amounts of previously unpublished footage in uncompromised quality. With the beautiful backdrop of Hubbles visual image treasures running as a red line through the movie, the light and dreaming style tells the most interesting stories about our fascinating Universe and about the change of vision that Hubble has brought us. The movie is accompanied by custom-made music that is second to none in quality and aesthetic expression.  \n\n\nDATOS DEL DVD\n\nSISTEMA: PAL\n\nAUDIO:  \n    * English\n    * German\n    * Greek\n\nSUBTITULOS:\n    * Bulgarian\n    * Dansk\n    * Deutsch\n    * Greek\n    * EspaÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±ol\n    * FranÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§ais\n    * Italiano\n    * Nederlands\n    * Norsk\n    * Polski\n    * Portugues\n    * Russian\n    * Suomi\n    * Svenska\n\n\nMeTODO DE RIPEO\n\nFORMATO: DVD9 =&gt; DVD9\n\nCOMPRESIoN:Sin Compresion. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fad58496805caab4a59fde481e9c3e61d83c108","amp;dn":"Hubble+-+15+Years+Of+Discovery","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fad58496805caab4a59fde481e9c3e61d83c108","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,173,88,73,104,5,202,171,74,89,253,228,129,233,195,230,29,131,193,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
