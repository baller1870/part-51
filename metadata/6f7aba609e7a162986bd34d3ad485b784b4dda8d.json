For the complete dvd visit fanedit.org\n\nCuts removed/added/extended: \nAll profanities are gone. it&amp;#039;s not that I hate profanity, it just seem like bad writing. \nTrim the awkward scenes. \nThe sex scene is gone. See above \nBill Paxton&amp;#039;s character humor is gone. \nMaria Conchita Alonso... mostly gone. \nMorton Downey Jr.&amp;#039;s gone. \nMany more trims to remember. \n\n\nConceptual improvements/advancements of edit over original: Jeez, where to begin. I was very dissappointed by the sequel. \nIt had none of the (hehe) gravitas of the original. There was a lot of shouting and cursing. \nPoor Danny Glover was saddle with a role that I don&amp;#039;t believe he enjoyed. So I clean all that stuff up so now it&amp;#039;s shinny and new.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++ABOUT FANEDITS+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nA fan edit is a version of a film modified by a viewer, that removes, reorders, or adds material in order to create a new interpretation of the film.
