For Charlie, the future is less clearly defined. A small-time hood, he works for his uncle, making collections and reclaiming bad debts. He&amp;#039;s probably too nice to succeed. In love with a woman his uncle disapproves of (because of her epilepsy) and a friend of her cousin, Johnny Boy, a near psychotic whose trouble-making threatens them all - he can&amp;#039;t reconcile opposing values. A failed attempt to escape (to Brooklyn) moves them all a step closer to a bitter, almost preordained future. \n\nCast(Cast overview, first billed only)\n\n\tRobert De Niro\t... \tJohn &amp;#039;Johnny Boy&amp;#039; Civello\n\n\tHarvey Keitel\t... \tCharlie Cappa\n\n\tDavid Proval\t... \tTony DeVienazo\n\tAmy Robinson\t... \tTeresa Ronchelli\n\tRichard Romanus\t... \tMichael Longo\n\tCesare Danova\t... \tGiovanni Cappa\n\tVictor Argo\t... \tMario (as Vic Argo)\n\tGeorge Memmoli\t... \tJoey &amp;#039;Clams&amp;#039; Scala\n\tLenny Scaletta\t... \tJimmy\n\tJeannie Bell\t... \tDiane\n\tMurray Moston\t... \tOscar (as Murray Mosten)\n\n\tDavid Carradine\t... \tDrunk\n\n\tRobert Carradine\t... \tDrunk&amp;#039;s Killer\n\tLois Walden\t... \tJewish Girl\n\n\tHarry Northup\t... \tJerry the Soldier\n\nRuntime: 107 min\n\nCountry: USA\n\nLanguage: English and spanish\n \nSubtitles: spanish\n\nRegion: PAL\n\nNo compression, the original it`s a DvD5\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30fcb63fbf445d034c08366c86687877188bd010","amp;dn":"Mean+Streets%28Scorsese%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30fcb63fbf445d034c08366c86687877188bd010","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,252,182,63,191,68,93,3,76,8,54,108,134,104,120,119,24,139,208,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
