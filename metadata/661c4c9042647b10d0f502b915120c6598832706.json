In the late 1980s the orphaned Karl Koch invests his heritage in a flat and a home computer. At first he dials up to bulletin boards to discuss conspiracy theories inspired by his favorite novel, R.A. Wilson&amp;#039;s &quot;Illuminatus&quot;, but soon he and his friend David start breaking into government and military computers. Pepe, one of Karl&amp;#039;s rather criminal acquaintances senses that there is money in computer cracking - he travels to east Berlin and tries to contact the KGB.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:661c4c9042647b10d0f502b915120c6598832706","amp;dn":"23+Nichts+is+so+wie+es+scheint","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"661c4c9042647b10d0f502b915120c6598832706","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,28,76,144,66,100,123,16,208,245,2,185,21,18,12,101,152,131,39,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
