In fact, this is an excellent album that maintains the group&amp;#039;s rich sound.   It&amp;#039;s just that the songs aren&amp;#039;t quite as consistently classic as they are on Ras Mek Peace and Unpolished (but they&amp;#039;re damn close)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d33c9c7c87b6adbcbef518b2de411b6e8f86511","amp;dn":"Jubilees+Of+Zion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d33c9c7c87b6adbcbef518b2de411b6e8f86511","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,51,201,199,200,123,106,219,203,239,81,139,45,228,17,182,232,248,101,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
