Before that we talk about why you should also listen to his podcast and about a really nice workshop. I have to work at that time (May 5th to 7th), but otherwise I would have shelled out the money and gone there.\n\nThen I?ll show you a new way to make a frame around an image or to do a triptych. It works with layer masks. The tip to do it that way was sent by Jason from New York.\n\nFinally you?ll see all the triptychs made by you in a slideshow to the full lenth ?Surreal in Vienna? by _Ghost - the music I use in the intro.
