Rex - Electric Warrior (1971)\n\nInitially a British folk-rock combo called Tyrannosaurus Rex, T. Rex was the primary force in glam rock, thanks to the creative direction of guitarist/vocalist Marc Bolan (born Marc Feld). Bolan created a deliberately trashy form of rock &amp; roll that was proud of its own disposability. T. Rex&amp;#039;s music borrowed the underlying sexuality of early rock &amp; roll, adding dirty, simple grooves and fat distorted guitars, as well as an overarching folky/hippie spirituality that always came through the clearest on ballads.\n\nElectric Warrior, T. Rex&amp;#039;s best album, distills elements of Marc Bolan&amp;#039;s earlier acoustic period with a dynamic rock rhythm section--drummer Bill Legend and bassist Steve Currie--and lush arrangements by producer Tony Visconti. Featuring the classics &quot;Bang a Gong (Get It On),&quot; &quot;Jeepster,&quot; and &quot;Mambo Sun,&quot; Warrior ranges from the space blues of &quot;Lean Woman Blues&quot; to the punk jazz of &quot;Rip Off,&quot; with a sound fleshed out by chamber strings and the falsetto harmonies of ex-Turtles and Mothers of Invention members Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman. (Zappa sideman Ian McDonald plays sax as well.) Touches such as the arcing cellos of &quot;Cosmic Dancer&quot; and the sexy rhythms of &quot;Planet Queen&quot; perfectly bring to life Bolan&amp;#039;s imaginative world of &quot;diamond star halos&quot; and &quot;shadowless horses.&quot; A must for any serious collector of British rock classics. This remastered reissue is fleshed out with a half-dozen bonus tracks and a band interview.\n\n\nTRACK LISTING\n\n01. Mambo Sun\n02. Cosmic Dancer\n03. Jeepster\n04. Monolith\n05.
