Things unfold when her Swedish husband, Bror Blixen (Klaus Maria Brandauer) begins cheating on her and is away on business often, so she&amp;#039;s at home alone, working on the farm and bonding with two men she met in her first day in Africa. She eventually falls in love with the one, Denys Finch-Hatton (Robert Redford) and goes on safari and whatnot with him. Later, she begins to want more from him than the simple friendship/relationship they have and pushes marriage, but Denys still wants his freedom. By the end, she&amp;#039;s gained a much better understanding and respect for the African culture than when she came. Won 7 Oscars.\n\nThis is a movie for huge screens, hence no compression.
