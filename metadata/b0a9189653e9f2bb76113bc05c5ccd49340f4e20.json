In the\n  labs associated with this chapter we create some integer-based\n  math subroutines for use in Chapter 5.\nChapter 5 Creating an Integer Calculator                             123\n  This is where things really start to get interesting because we\n  use the subroutines we developed in Chapter 4 to implement\n  a simple four-function integer calculator.\nChapter 6 More Functions and Experiments                            135\n  This may be the last chapter, but turn that frown upside down\n  into a smile because this is where we discover additional\n  projects you can undertake, and also how you can compete\n  with other readers to create better math routines for your\n  DIY Calculator.\nInteractive Laboratories                                        155?412\n  This is where you will find the interactive laboratories\n  associated with Chapters 2 through 5 (see more details\n  on page ix).\nAppendix A Installing Your DIY Calculator                           413\n  In this appendix, we learn how to install the virtual DIY\n  Calculator presented on the CD-ROM accompanying\n  this book.\nAppendix B Addressing Modes                                         417\n  Here we learn about the various addressing modes supported\n  by the virtual microprocessor powering the DIY Calculator.\nAppendix C Instruction Set Summary                                  429\n  The tables in this appendix are useful for quickly determining\n  which instructions are available with which addressing modes.\nAppendix D Additional Resources                                     433\n  There is a wealth of additional resources for individual\n  readers and educators on the CD-ROM accompanying the\n  book and from the DIY Calculator?s website. Also, there are\n  lots of other really interesting books to read. This appendix\n  explains it all.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0a9189653e9f2bb76113bc05c5ccd49340f4e20","amp;dn":"How+Computers+do+Math","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0a9189653e9f2bb76113bc05c5ccd49340f4e20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,169,24,150,83,233,242,187,118,17,59,192,92,92,205,73,52,15,78,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
