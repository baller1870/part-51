Five King Cobras were imported from Thailand for this feature, they ranged from 10-15&amp;#039; in length. They were recently wild caught and in good health with full venom capabilities. The &quot;Snake Park&quot; milking scenes were real and meant to mimic what Bill Haast did at his Serpentarium in Florida daily. About one ounce of venom was collected during each take with no harm to the snakes. A different cobra was used for each take. The filming of this part of the movie took most of a day, as the cobras spent most of their time trying to escape the fenced enclosure rather than raising up in the traditional cobra attack mode.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a885a6c2c6e605656990b43c21f92c077595c698","amp;dn":"Sssssss","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a885a6c2c6e605656990b43c21f92c077595c698","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,133,166,194,198,230,5,101,105,144,180,60,33,249,44,7,117,149,198,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
