The wide, open landscapes of yet to be developed land and the minimal score add amazing scope to the loneliness Marcos (Vicente Parra) feels, and mirrors the loneliness of his newfound friend that lives in the highrise literally next door to his little house. Even the swimming scene had a quiet beauty to it. Considering the time and politics for 1971 in that area, there&amp;#039;s more to this story than just a man not able to cope with his murderous actions.\n\nThe neighbor&amp;#039;s sexuality is handled in a rather refreshingly basic manner, not being stereotypically gay nor lecherous. It&amp;#039;s also great how throughout the film, we wonder if he really knows more about what Marcos is doing than we can guess, with lines like &quot;You better bury them,&quot; is he talking about Marcos&amp;#039; memories or the bodies starting to add up in Marcos&amp;#039; bedroom? Their interactions are always fascinating, and were very much highpoints of the film. It was wonderful to see a scene like the swimming scene with these two men; somehow I get the feeling that if this film were to have been made today, the powers that be in Hollywood would have tried to work that scene with two women. \n\nAn increasing depressing tone sets in up through to the end, but some nice dialogues keep the story in check and moving despite the slower tone of the film. The violence works in context to the situations, rather than seeming gratuitous to satisfy those who feel they need to see that in order to enjoy a film. For me, I was far more disturbed by the first minute of the film, seeing the animal slaughtered. It was difficult getting through that. The sexual element is surprisingly minimal, not as much nudity as you&amp;#039;d think a film of this storyline would have, but since it&amp;#039;s not really an exploitive film, having less breasts to gawk at works in its favor. Like many films of that European source and time, having no end credits leaves the viewer in a more affected mood with the film&amp;#039;s rather abrupt ending.\n\nLA SEMANA DEL ASESINO is great viewing for fans of drama, but horror seekers should stay clear. It&amp;#039;s good to see other people commenting about the film&amp;#039;s interesting qualities instead of reading comments that they felt ripped off that it wasn&amp;#039;t about cannibals or full of tense scary scenes. It&amp;#039;s pure drama, and I&amp;#039;m glad some people are managing to get around the unfortunate marketing ploys this film was given and see how worthwhile it really is! Indeed a nice discovery.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b86513b33c53ac3219c1533a54f51a875b0970d4","amp;dn":"Cannibal+Man+%281974%29.......FFF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b86513b33c53ac3219c1533a54f51a875b0970d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,101,19,179,60,83,172,50,25,193,83,58,84,245,26,135,91,9,112,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
