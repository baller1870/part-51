Can install/remove grub from MBR, fix damaged mbr&amp;#039;s, Linux, Windows, it does not matter, can boot directly off cd or boot existing partitions when that late-night install fest has left your mbr&amp;#039;s hosed. If it has data it can probably be booted by this cd. A stunning addition (if not replacement) to your rescue cd collection. Enjoy.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:530509dd2ff828423838b7dc180339035d9e07f6","amp;dn":"Super+Grub+Disk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"530509dd2ff828423838b7dc180339035d9e07f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,5,9,221,47,248,40,66,56,56,183,220,24,3,57,3,93,158,7,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
