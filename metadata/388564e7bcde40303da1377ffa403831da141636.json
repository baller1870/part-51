In 2016 America has become a place of fear and suspicion. Terrorism and government crackdowns have brought on a cycle of spiraling inflation and unemployment. Basic civil liberties are at risk in a country changed, yet frighteningly familiar.\n\nA prominent citizen and commander in the West Virginia National Guard, Ken Murphy, must protect his family and his country, and identify where his loyalties lay in an increasingly dangerous conflict.\n\nCopyright Ã‚Â© 2007 Charles Sheehan-Miles This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives 2.5 License.
