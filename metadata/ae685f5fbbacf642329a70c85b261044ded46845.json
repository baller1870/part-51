On June 6, 1944 ? D-Day ? in the European Theater, a million and a half Allied troops embark on one of the greatest invasions in history: the invasion of France. Among them are Dwain Luce of Mobile, who drops behind enemy lines in a glider; Quentin Aanenson of Luverne, who flies his first combat mission over the Normandy coast; and Joseph Vaghi of Waterbury, who manages to survive the disastrous landing on Omaha Beach where German resistance nearly decimates the American forces. It is the bloodiest day in American history since the Civil War, with nearly 2,500 Americans losing their lives. But the Allies succeed in tearing a 45-mile gap in Hitler?s vaunted Atlantic Wall, and by day?s end more than 150,000 men have landed on French soil. They quickly find themselves bogged down in the Norman hedgerows, facing German troops determined to make them pay for every inch of territory they gain. For months, the Allies must measure their progress in yards, and they suffer far greater casualties than anyone expected.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae685f5fbbacf642329a70c85b261044ded46845","amp;dn":"The+War+E04+Pride+of+Our+Nation+June+1944-August+1944+HDTV+XviD+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae685f5fbbacf642329a70c85b261044ded46845","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,104,95,95,187,172,246,66,50,154,112,200,91,38,16,68,222,212,104,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
