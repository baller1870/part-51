The information in Zeitgeist was established over a year-long period of research, and the current Source List page onlists the sources used / referenced. Soon, an interactive transcript will be on line, with detailed footnotes and links.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s important to point out that there is a tendency simply to disbelieve things that are counter to our understanding, without performing the necessary research. For example, some information contained in Part 1 and in Part 3, specifically, is not obtained by simple keyword searches on the Internet. You have to dig deeper. Very often people who look up &quot;Horus&quot; or &quot;The Federal Reserve&quot; on the Internet draw their conclusions from very general or biased sources. Online encyclopedias or text book encyclopedias often do not contain the information contained in Zeitgeist. However, if one takes the time to read the sources provided, he or she will find that what is being presented is based on documented evidence. Any corrections, clarifications &amp; further points regarding the film are found on the Clarifications page.\n\nThat being said, it is the publisher&amp;#039;s hope that people will not take what is said in the film as the truth, but will find out for themselves; for truth is not told, it is realized.\n\nThank you.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f729f86b076238f5379c3494313057cdc94e2128","amp;dn":"Zeitgeist.%282007%29.DVDRip.XviD-mp3.credits.V-delay_corrected.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f729f86b076238f5379c3494313057cdc94e2128","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,41,248,107,7,98,56,245,55,156,52,148,49,48,87,205,201,78,33,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
