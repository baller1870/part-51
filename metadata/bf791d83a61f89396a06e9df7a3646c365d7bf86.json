Swedish vocalist Siw Malmkvist sings &quot;Midnattssolen&quot; (The Mignight Sun Never Sets). This track can&amp;#039;t be found on any of the CD releaes. This was picked up from a decent record. Audio was restored as best possible using Adobe Audition, for picking up the audio I used an Ortofon MC20 moving coil pickup connected to a Ortofon MCA-76 moving coil preamplifier. These are great stuff for capturing the true dynamic sound of the old vinyl records.\nThis is my first uploaded torrent file ever so I cannot guarantee it will work.\n\nEnjoy this track, tributing one of Sweden&amp;#039;s finest vocalists ever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf791d83a61f89396a06e9df7a3646c365d7bf86","amp;dn":"Siw+Malmkvist+-+Midnattssolen.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf791d83a61f89396a06e9df7a3646c365d7bf86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,121,29,131,166,31,137,57,106,6,233,223,122,54,70,195,101,215,191,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
