Part confessional and part performance, blogging has been heralded as the biggest revolution in journalism since the invention of radio but, as Andrew demonstrates, it&amp;#039;s really just a jamboree for the kind of people who write round-robins at Christmas and also a massive repository of staircase wit.\n\n\nAndrew blogs obsessively about his life and loves. In his case, this is a collection of military war-gaming enthusiasts, some tiny painted pewter soldiers, his terrifying Czech mother and the mysterious Mr Demjanjuk.\n\n\nCaroline Quentin (Men Behaving Badly) gives a virtuoso performance of all the female parts, Simon Greenall (I&amp;#039;m Alan Partridge) stars as supporting male characters, and Andy Taylor (Harry Enfield&amp;#039;s Television Programme) plays Andrew Glasgow.\n\n\nOn The Blog was conceived and written by two of the most exciting young writers around ? Kris Dyer and Dave Marks ? otherwise known as double-act Nice Mum. They also make their radio debuts as performers (in the tiny parts no-one else wanted).\n\n\n[HerMes Digital Media]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dea492180353db89e774124072101cee26767dcb","amp;dn":"On+the+Blog+%5BHerMes%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dea492180353db89e774124072101cee26767dcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,164,146,24,3,83,219,137,231,116,18,64,114,16,28,238,38,118,125,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
