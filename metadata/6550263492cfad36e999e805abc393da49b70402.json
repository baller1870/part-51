W. Bush. \n  \n\nWith detailed maps and graphics, The Oil Factor features many experts and personalities such as former Defense Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, M.I.T. professor Noam Chomsky, the Project for the New American Century Executive Director Gary Schmitt, Coalition Provisional Authority Chairman Paul Bremer, former Pentagon analyst Lt. Col. Karen Kwiatkowski, current Iraqi government official Abdel Aziz Al-Hakim and authors Ahmed Rashid and Michael C. Ruppert. \n       \n\nContributing organizations include the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Greenpeace, the Pentagon, Washington&amp;#039;s Institute for Policy Studies, New York&amp;#039;s World Policy Institute, London&amp;#039;s Jane&amp;#039;s Intelligence and Petroleum Economist, Paris&amp;#039; Agence France Press and Center for Energy Strategy Studies (C.E.P.S.E.) or the Organization for Economic and Cooperative Development (O.E.C.D.)\n\n\nTHE OIL FACTOR: Behind the War on Terror is a 2004 Free-Will Production\n\n\nTo purchase this video, please visit: http://www.theoilfactor.com\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information on September 11th, NWO and the great threat to you can be found at www.infowars.com or www.prisonplanet.tv\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6550263492cfad36e999e805abc393da49b70402","amp;dn":"The+Oil+Factor.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6550263492cfad36e999e805abc393da49b70402","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,80,38,52,146,207,173,54,233,153,232,5,171,195,147,218,73,183,4,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
