It combines shadow/highlight, virtual\n            lighting and color-based correction tools for performing\n         sophisticated corrections without the need for time-consuming\n       selections and layer stacks. LightMachine can correct brightness,\n       contrast and saturation in specific image areas independently from\n          each other. It lets you correct photos taken under bad light\n        conditions or with bad camera settings and achieve results that\n       rival photos taken under the best circumstances. LightMachine can\n        be used in dozens of graphics applications including Photoshop,\n       Paint Shop Pro, IrfanView, Photoshop Elements, PhotoImpact, Photo\n         -Paint and Fireworks. LightMachine can be applied to 8bit and\n                               16bit RGB images.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5437d3bc43e0f6501789c57bc8b34f8dc4a7e69f","amp;dn":"fo-lm10.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5437d3bc43e0f6501789c57bc8b34f8dc4a7e69f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,55,211,188,67,224,246,80,23,137,197,123,200,179,79,141,196,167,230,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
