For the youth political movement, the seemingly ineffectual methods of peaceful protest and resistance led to the rise of an idealistic faction that want a more extreme approach that the Establishment could not ignore. This faction, called the Weather Underground, attempted to team up with the Black Panthers to violently confront the US government that started with street riots and escalating to bombing government targets. Thorough archival footage and interviews of the veterans of both sides of this conflict, this film covers the resistance movement&amp;#039;s campaign of selective violence through this period until changing times and disillusionment brought it to an end while the FBI used unethical and illegal methods to hasten it.&quot;\n\n\nFormat: 4:3 NTSC\nLanguages: English\nSubtitles: Spanish\n\nExtras:\nAudio commentaries by former weathmermen Bernadine Dohrn and Bill Ayers\nFilmmaker&amp;#039;s commentary\n\nRest is stripped for size.
