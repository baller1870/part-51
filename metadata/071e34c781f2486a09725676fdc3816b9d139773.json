If you are trying to run an application that requires ports to be forwarded, you can skip the work and just use PFConfig. With PFConfig, you don&amp;#039;t have to learn how to setup your router. It&amp;#039;s so easy to use, you just pick the program from a list and say &amp;#039;Update Router&amp;#039;.\n\nPortTrigger \n\n \n  When you run out of Port Forwarding space on your router, you can use the port triggering section to accomplish the same task. Simply run our PortTrigger application on the computer that you want to have ports forwarded to, and like magic your application starts working. No more logging in to your router every time you switch applications just because your router doesn&amp;#039;t have enough port forwarding capacity.\n\nhave fun with this one the serial is added and it works 100%\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:071e34c781f2486a09725676fdc3816b9d139773","amp;dn":"pcconfig","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"071e34c781f2486a09725676fdc3816b9d139773","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,30,52,199,129,242,72,106,9,114,86,118,253,195,129,107,157,19,151,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
