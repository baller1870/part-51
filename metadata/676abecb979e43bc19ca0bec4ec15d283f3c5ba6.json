When Scotland Yard launched one of the biggest \ninvestigations in its history, another first was quickly uncovered: \nthe suicide bombers were home-grown; they were young British men, \nattacking their own country. Suicide Bombers: A Psychological \nInvestigation documents how a handful of experts have dedicated their\nlives to understanding the mind of the suicide bomber. It\\&amp;#039;s a field \nthat has grown rapidly in recent years as suicide attacks have become\nthe weapon of choice for extremist groups around the world. These \nexperts are challenging our preconceptions about who these suicide \nbombers are. What was revealed through early research conducted by \nAriel Merari from Tel Aviv University was that suicide bombers \nweren\\&amp;#039;t mad, weren\\&amp;#039;t psychopaths, in fact they did not have any \npsychological flaws that set them apart. \n\n_________________________________________________________________d0x__","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:676abecb979e43bc19ca0bec4ec15d283f3c5ba6","amp;dn":"Suicide+Bombers+-+A+Psychological+Investigation+%28BBC+Horizon%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"676abecb979e43bc19ca0bec4ec15d283f3c5ba6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,106,190,203,151,158,67,188,25,202,11,236,78,193,93,40,63,60,91,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
