Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy journeys from the Zimbabwean border to one of Johannesburg\\&amp;#039;s most dangerous quarters to investigate.\n\nFriday 13 October 2006 7.35pm\nSunday 15 October 2006 4.35am (R)\n\nReporter Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy and Director Robin Barnwell begin their film on the Zimbabwean border with a group of Zimbabweans as they begin a long journey to Johannesburg. The South African police stop them but let them go in exchange it is claimed, for a bribe, which the people smugglers claim is routine.\n\nThe Zimbabweans say they are fleeing a collapsing state, where President Mugabe?s policies have driven the economy into crisis and where earning enough to feed their families is impossible. However, the South Africans blame them for a crime wave and accuse them of causing unemployment.\n\nWhite farmers in the Limpopo border region tell Unreported World that the immigrants are perpetrating brutal farm murders and poaching their game. The team films several farmers taking the law into their own hands by rounding them up, tying them together and handing them over to the police.\n\nIt?s not just the farmers who believe these migrants are fuelling a crime wave. The team moves on to Johannesburg and films with police in one of the city?s most dangerous areas. They accompany officers who routinely use plastic bullets to round up suspected illegal immigrants.\n\nThose they catch are sent to the Lindela detention centre. The team interview a group of Congolese men who accuse the guards of severely beating them. Another inmate laments that South Africans have forgotten the support that their ?African brothers? gave them during the days of Apartheid and accuses black South Africans of being the ?biggest racists in the world?.\n\nThe team then travel to the suburb of Diepsloot where the local South African business community has written an extraordinary letter to Somalian shopkeepers asking them to leave. The shopkeepers - who say they?re asylum seekers rather than illegal immigrants - fear they will suffer similar violent attacks to those suffered by other immigrant communities.\n\nA group of protestors gathers, demanding that South Africa should be for South Africans only. One woman tells Unreported World that black South Africans fought long and hard to gain their freedom that these benefits are now being stolen by illegal immigrants.\n\nThe team are then allowed to film on board a train returning 400 Zimbabwean illegal immigrants back to the border. Some are so desperate to remain, that they throw themselves from the moving train during the night. Almost all say they will be back in the country within a few days. Given the ever-worsening economic environment in Zimbabwe they say they have no other choice.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/news/microsites/U/unreportedworld/southafrica.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/news/microsites/U/unreportedworld/southafrica.html&lt;/a&gt;\n------------------------------------\nTech specs (thanks to SUPER)\n\nGeneral #0 \nFormat : AVI \nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave \nFormat/Family : RIFF \nFile size : 198 MiB \nPlayTime : 24mn 15s \nBit rate : 1135 Kbps \nWriting application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release) \nWriting library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release \n\nVideo #0 \nCodec : XviD \nCodec/Family : MPEG-4 \nCodec/Info : XviD project \nCodec settings/BVOP : Yes \nCodec settings/QPel : No \nCodec settings/GMC : 0 \nCodec settings/Matrix : Default \nPlayTime : 24mn 15s \nBit rate : 991 Kbps \nWidth : 640 pixels \nHeight : 352 pixels \nAspect ratio : 16/9 \nFrame rate : 25.000 fps \nResolution : 8 bits \nChroma : 4:2:0 \nInterlacement : Progressive \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.176 \nWriting library : XviD0041 \n\nAudio #0 \nCodec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3 \nCodec profile : Joint stereo \nPlayTime : 24mn 15s \nBit rate : 131 Kbps \nBit rate mode : VBR \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nSampling rate : 48 KHz \nResolution : 16 bits \nWriting library : LAME3.90. \n\n===============================================================================\nLearn the true nature of the world, come visit our huge dedicated e-library and forums @ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969/index.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.info/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.info/index.php&lt;/a&gt;\n===============================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00824435fc1bb581f26e66ab39e1fa5628d21a22","amp;dn":"Channel+Four+-+Unreported+World+-+The+New+Apartheid+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00824435fc1bb581f26e66ab39e1fa5628d21a22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,130,68,53,252,27,181,129,242,110,102,171,57,225,250,86,40,210,26,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
