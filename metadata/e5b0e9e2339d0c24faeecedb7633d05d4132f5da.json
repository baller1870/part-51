Thompson&amp;#039;s novel of the same name. The film details a wacky search for the &quot;American Dream&quot;, by Thompson and his crazed, Samoan lawyer.

Encountering police, reporters, gamblers, racers, and hitchhikers; they search for some undefinable thing know only as the &quot;American Dream&quot; and find fear, loathing and hilarious adventures into the dementia of the modern American West.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5b0e9e2339d0c24faeecedb7633d05d4132f5da","amp;dn":"Fear+and+Loathing+in+Las+Vegas%28re+Release%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5b0e9e2339d0c24faeecedb7633d05d4132f5da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,176,233,226,51,157,12,36,250,238,206,219,118,51,208,93,65,50,245,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
