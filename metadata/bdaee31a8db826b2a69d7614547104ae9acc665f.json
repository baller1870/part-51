It objectively and methodically documents the hidden alliance between new versions and the New Age Movement&amp;#039;s One World Religion. The emerging new Christianity - with its substitution of riches for righteousness, a crown for a cross, and an imitation for a new creation - is shown to be a direct result of the wording in new versions.
