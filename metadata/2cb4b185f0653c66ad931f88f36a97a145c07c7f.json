Due to the time when the first was released, they were unable to use all the in-game music in that album.  This release contains 12 tracks, each one being a multi-part movement from various levels and areas in Halo 2.\n\nAudio is ripped using cdparanoia (non-Windows equivalent of EAC) and encoded using aoTuV Ogg Vorbis at q3.  If you want high fidelity, I&amp;#039;d recommend you buy the album or something (it&amp;#039;s worth it if you like classical music or enjoy the music from Halo 2).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cb4b185f0653c66ad931f88f36a97a145c07c7f","amp;dn":"Halo+2+-+Original+Soundtrack+-+Volume+Two+%5BOgg+Vorbis%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cb4b185f0653c66ad931f88f36a97a145c07c7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,180,177,133,240,101,60,102,173,147,31,136,243,106,151,161,69,192,124,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
