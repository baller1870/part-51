Hughley delivers the laughs in his forth HBO specialty subtitled UNAPOLOGETIC, which was filmed in Washington DC. After the disastrous BOB SAGET: THAT AIN&amp;#039;T RIGHT, this comic confection was a breath of fresh air, offering an amusing look at topics that weren&amp;#039;t terribly original, but Hughley&amp;#039;s outlook and much more selective use of adult language works to much greater effect here than Saget. One of Hughley&amp;#039;s favorite topics is male/female relationship and he gets off some on-target shots on this well-worn subject, and as always, shows his flare for spontaneity by goofing on members of the audience in the theater. The subject matter may not be strikingly original, but Hughley&amp;#039;s twisted view and on-target delivery almost always works.\n\nScreen Shots:  \n               \n\n\nGenre:      Comedy\nFormat:     bin\\cue\nTime:       51:17\nSize:       803MB\nChapters:   every 5 min.\nAudio:      AC3\nVideo:      MPEG-1 352x240 23.976fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b4354b0cb5bc2b94cc1848187778e5965319c2d","amp;dn":"D.L.Hughley.Unapologetic.DVDRip.XviD-DIMENSION-%28KvCD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b4354b0cb5bc2b94cc1848187778e5965319c2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,67,84,176,203,91,194,185,76,193,132,129,135,119,142,89,101,49,156,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
