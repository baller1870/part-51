To fight the incredible depression and suicide throughout the ghetto, Jakob tells fictitious news bulletins about Allied advances against the Nazis. These lies keep hope and humor alive among the ghetto inhabitants. The Germans learn of the mythical radio, however, and begin a search for the resistance hero who dares operate it.\n\nRipped by Invictusprime.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d96c8aa7e6a5e95152cb42034fd73fae8db1d4a6","amp;dn":"Jakob+The+Liar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d96c8aa7e6a5e95152cb42034fd73fae8db1d4a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,108,138,167,230,165,233,81,82,203,66,3,79,215,63,174,141,177,212,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
