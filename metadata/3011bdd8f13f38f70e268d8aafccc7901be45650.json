The two brothers take on the most confounding criminal cases from a very distinctive perspective. Inspired by actual cases, the series depicts how the confluence of police work and mathematics provides unexpected revelations and answers to the most perplexing criminal questions. A dedicated FBI agent, Don Eppes (Rob Morrow), couldnÃ‚Â´t be more different from his younger brother, Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz), a brilliant mathematician who, since he was little, yearned to impress his big brother. As a seasoned investigator, Don deals in hard facts and evidence, whereas Charlie, a math professor at a California university, functions in a world of mathematical probability and equations. Now, despite their disparate approaches to life, Don and Charlie are able to combine their areas of expertise and solve some killer cases..\n\n\nDVD9-&gt;DVD5 Rebuilder + CCE 4 pasadas\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3011bdd8f13f38f70e268d8aafccc7901be45650","amp;dn":"Numb3rs+%28TV+Series%29+Season+2+DVD+6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3011bdd8f13f38f70e268d8aafccc7901be45650","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,17,189,216,241,63,56,247,14,38,141,138,175,204,199,144,27,228,86,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
