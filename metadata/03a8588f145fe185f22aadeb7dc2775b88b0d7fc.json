The quality is good and it&amp;#039;s NOT a theater copy.\n\nThe original was too long and really lame. My version cuts out a half hour of footage that was either pointless to have in the movie or was just plan lame. It&amp;#039;s still not perfect and that\\&amp;#039;s why I call it the Not So Lame Version. I couldn&amp;#039;t get rid of all the lame, but this makes the movie better.\n\nScenes Removed:\n\n- Mary Jane and Peter back stage after Mary Jane&amp;#039;s show\n- Aunt May talking about marrying Uncle Ben\n- A Daily Bugle scene where J. J. is being pitched an idea\n- The part with Stan Lee in it/Peter finds out he&amp;#039;s getting the key to the city\n- The key to the city ceremony\n- Some of Peter at the restaurant before Mary Jane arrives\n- Peter leaving a message on Mary Jane&amp;#039;s answering machine\n- Peter&amp;#039;s landlord and daughter scenes\n- Harry and Mary Jane in Harry&amp;#039;s kitchen dancing and cooking\n- Peter dancing around the city\n- Peter talking to Dr. Conors on the phone\n- The Jazz club scene where Peter dances and acts like an idiot\n- The news reports on Venom and Sandman\n- The British news reporter\n- J. J. wanting to buy a little girls camera during the final battle\n- The crowd watching the final battle\n- The last scene where Peter walks into the club where Mary Jane is singing\n- Other scenes are shortened and some lame dialogue is removed. You might not even         notice or remember some scenes that are cut. \n\nINFO\n\nWidescreen\nVideo - Xvid\nAudio - Lame mp3\nRunning Time - 1:50:35\n\n\nTwo scenes I cut out are on youtube.\n\nThe Jazz club scene: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQ9r8dE7_iY&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQ9r8dE7_iY&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPeter dancing down the streets of New York &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7z9jRV2uqU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7z9jRV2uqU&lt;/a&gt; \n\nAll comments are welcome, good or bad. If you&amp;#039;re going to flame me for making this make sure your comments are creative and as hilarious as possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03a8588f145fe185f22aadeb7dc2775b88b0d7fc","amp;dn":"Spider-Man+3+-+Not+So+Lame+Version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03a8588f145fe185f22aadeb7dc2775b88b0d7fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,168,88,143,20,95,225,133,242,42,173,235,125,194,119,91,136,176,215,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
