These nano machines thrive in extreme alkaline ph conditions and use the body\\\\\\&amp;#039;s bio-electric energy and other (unidentified) elements for power.  (People should *not* strive for an acidic ph - they should work for a normal pH of  7.5 +/-).  There is some evidence these tiny machines possess their own internal batteries. They are also believed to be able to receive specific tuned microwave, EMF and ELF signals and information. To what end is not known. The symptoms vary from open skin lesions from which colored or plain fibers emerge, which do not scab normally, heal extremely slowly and never become bacterially-infected -- to brain fog, fatigue and depression, etc. It is also established that Morgellons nano machines are commonly found in all body fluids, orifices and often even hair follicles, and are believed to routinely achieve total body systemic penetration. It is reported by nearly all afflicted that Morgellons nano machines seem to have some kind of hive or \\\\\\&amp;#039;group intelligence.\\\\\\&amp;#039; Communicability appears to be possible/probable through shedding of the fibers by the infected and through all normal bacterial or viral vectors. Some fibers have been shown to withstand temperatures in excess of 1400 F, routine sterilization for Morgellons nano machines in all reusable medical/dental medical equipment and instruments is moot. There is also strong evidence linking Chemtrail aerosol fibers to Morgellons fibers although proof of transmission through aerial spraying remains anecdotal.   \n\n\nIncluded are a bunch of files, mostly video files and series of Rense radio shows, introducing you to the phenomenon of the strange but invasive new ecto-parasitic disease called Morgellons.\n\n===============================================================================\nOur leaders lie, cheat, steal and kill with virtual impunity.
