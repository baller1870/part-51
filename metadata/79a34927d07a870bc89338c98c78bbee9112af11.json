In this album, Metro not only provided first cut tunes by these two groups, but also the sounds of three new groups at that time (The Moquettes, The Cherokees, and The Symbols). This album was a re-issue of the USA 1965 album &quot;Mickie Most Presents British Go-Go&quot;&lt;\n\nIf you&amp;#039;re looking for audiophile quality, look elsewhere! Apart from removing the &quot;big pops&quot; and coinerting the L &amp; R channels into 1 channel, I have left this album untouched.  You will hear some clicks, but nothing that should detract from your enjoyment(except maybe some of the music itself!)of a record that is 41 years old. \n\nThe album itself is a reissue of a prior album, and it sounds like it was hastily mastered (check out the level drop in &quot;You Came Along&quot;).  That said, it is a unique slice of British Invasion history, and probably the only place you will find tracks by The Symbols, The Cherokees, and The Moquettes. \n\n01 Herman&amp;#039;s Hermits - &quot;Wonderful World&quot; \n02 The Symbols - &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Go&quot; \n03 The Cherokees - &quot;I Will Never Turn My Back On You&quot; \n04 The Animals - &quot;Bring It On Home To Me&quot; \n05 The Moquettes - &quot;You Came Along&quot; \n06 The Animals - &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot; \n07 The Moquettes - &quot;Right String Baby, But The Wrong Yo-Yo&quot; \n08 Herman&amp;#039;s Hermits - &quot;Mrs. Brown, You&amp;#039;ve Got A Lovely Daughter&quot; \n09 The Cherokees - &quot;Rejected&quot; \n10 The Symbols - &quot;You Are My Girl&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79a34927d07a870bc89338c98c78bbee9112af11","amp;dn":"Mickie+Most+Presents+English+In-Groups+%281966+mono+vinyl%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79a34927d07a870bc89338c98c78bbee9112af11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,163,73,39,208,122,135,11,200,147,56,201,140,120,187,238,145,18,175,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
