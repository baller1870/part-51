It features three videos from her debut A&amp;M release Union.  Dominic Sena directs the first one, &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Walk Away.&quot;  There&amp;#039;s also a short interview with Toni at the end.\n\nQuality is decent.  Video source was NTSC but, most of the video didn&amp;#039;t appear telecined.  It ended up looking better to me after just de-interlacing and leaving the frame rate alone.  Audio is MP3.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fae5a327811473546c45250339c5ffbf3330ec0","amp;dn":"Toni+Childs+-+The+Videos+-+VHS+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fae5a327811473546c45250339c5ffbf3330ec0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,174,90,50,120,17,71,53,70,196,82,80,51,156,95,251,243,51,14,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
