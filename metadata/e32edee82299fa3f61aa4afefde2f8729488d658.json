The Catholic Archbishop is released and sent to Rome, where the ailing Pope makes him a Cardinal. The world is in a state of crisis - a famine in China is exacerbated by United States restrictions on Chinese trade and the ongoing Chinese-Soviet feud. When the Pontiff dies, Lakota finds himself elected Pope. But the new Pope Kiril I is plagued by self-doubt, by his years in prison, and by the strange world he knows so little about. This movie contains extensive information about Catholic faith &amp; practice, as a television news reporter steps in from time-to-time to explain the procedures involved in selecting a new Pope.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e32edee82299fa3f61aa4afefde2f8729488d658","amp;dn":"The+Shoes+of+the+Fisherman--1968--","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e32edee82299fa3f61aa4afefde2f8729488d658","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,46,222,232,34,153,250,63,97,170,74,254,253,226,248,114,148,136,214,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
