The quality of the actors was usurped only by their unending interest in the story of Bill W and the important message they were delivering.\n\nJames Garner and James Woods were intensely focused on keeping the story of Dr. bob and Bill as true to form as possible. Jo Beth Williams played Lois Wilson incredibly well; first as a confused wife with no options and a drunkard husband; then as a strong willed but understanding partner for life.\n\nIf anyone has a loved one or knows of a friend whose life is impacted by an alcoholic, then this movie is both an eye opener and an inspiration to keep trying to find a way to fight and deal with the disease.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abcbe4eff6fba1c2575fda12d52cfc8113075553","amp;dn":"My+Name+is+Bill+W+-+True+Story+about+the+founding+of+AA+-+PLEASE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abcbe4eff6fba1c2575fda12d52cfc8113075553","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,203,228,239,246,251,161,194,87,95,218,18,213,44,252,129,19,7,85,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
