It is the town where he came from where very strange things started happening with his arrival in a spaceship in the midst of a meteor storm of green rocks. Clark must deal with a variety of individuals given powers by the green rocks, keep his powers a secret, cope with his friendship with a young Lex Luthor, and balance the two girls in his life, Chloe and Lana. The show also shows us how Lex Luthor develops from a friend of Clark&amp;#039;s and kinda-okay guy to (presumably) the villain who will plague Superman in his later years.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nCast:\n\nTom Welling, Kristin Kreuk, Michael Rosenbaum, Annette O&amp;#039;Toole, John Glover\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nThis is Season 6 Disc 1 will seed until there are enough copies out\n\n\n\nThere is spanish subtitles\nRegion Removed as well\nBurn image file onto standard DVD5 disc!\n\nEnjoy\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15ce5ed5eaa373f1b308469d5fa4f0623d800f00","amp;dn":"SMALLVILLE+Season+6+Disc+1+%28DVD5%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15ce5ed5eaa373f1b308469d5fa4f0623d800f00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,206,94,213,234,163,115,241,179,8,70,157,95,164,240,98,61,128,15,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
