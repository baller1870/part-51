Tony Snow said yesterday that it would take &quot;6 to 8 months&quot; to determine if the the 5th surge is the charm in Iraq. Maybe that&amp;#039;s how long it will take to connect the pipeline and force the Maliki &quot;government&quot; to sell its oil to Exxon.\n\nAnd despite the Bush/Cheney delusion that progress is being made in Iraq, another US helicopter was downed outside Baghdad. The fourth in 14 days. Elsewhere in Anbar, gunmen assassinated the Sunni chairman of the Fallujah City Council, Abbas Ali Hussein, an outspoken critic of al-Qaida, the third council leader to be killed in a year. How long does it take to realize the New Way Forward is making Iraq bloodier than ever?\n\nAnd finally today, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the decision to send a second U.S. aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf region does not mean the United States is planning for a war with Iran. Riiiiiight. And Bush is a uniter not a divider, er I mean decider.\n\n--KBM\n\nJoin the Fun and Frivolity 800-989-1480!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d23324ea6a9dbc5bfb29f3bddd89afa3a5e7a3d6","amp;dn":"Mike+Malloy-02-01-07","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d23324ea6a9dbc5bfb29f3bddd89afa3a5e7a3d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,51,36,234,106,157,188,91,251,41,243,189,221,137,175,163,165,231,163,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
