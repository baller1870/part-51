There is very little of the Tarkovsky touch here and the camera movements and the editing are quite traditional (but still very well done). It could almost have been made in Hollywood.\n\nWhat surprised me the most though was how good Tarkovsky was in directing a thriller. I was biting my nails midway though the film. See it if you possibly can.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\n \nAnd one more review from IMDB\n\nI never much liked the poor visual style of the most soviet films I&amp;#039;ve seen. But this one caught my attention, for that it&amp;#039;s very stylishly done.\n\nThe short film tells a story of a little soviet town where during roadworks a stockpile of WWII bombshells was discovered buried under the ground. The town gets evacuated &amp; the army men have to remove the discovery accurately so that it doesn&amp;#039;t blow away the buildings nearby. Tarkovsky even threw in some subplots. One being a man who was in the army during WWII and offered his help. The other - a surgeon, operating a wounded person in the evacuated town&amp;#039;s hospital.\n\nThe film is fast paced and very well done. It holds an atmosphere of tension, makes the viewer fear that the shells will explode any second. Scenes are cleverly composed and memorable with first time appearances by famous Russian actors Leonid Kuravlyov and Stas Liubshin. The film&amp;#039;s title comes from Kuravlyov character&amp;#039;s line: &quot;Yes, bro, seems like there will be no leave today&quot;. Probably the best short I&amp;#039;ve ever seen.\n\nThanks to fvb fo the subtitles and igorert for upload elsewhere\n\nFile Name .............: Segodnya.Uvolneniya.ne.Budet.(1959).[SatRip].[rus.sub.fra].[Xvid].avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 449,320,960 bytes\nRuntime (# of frames) .: 46:27.760 (4193344 frames)\n\nVideo Codec ...........: XviD 1.1.0 Beta 1\nFrame Size ............: 512x384  [=1.333]\nFPS ...................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate .........: 1181 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ........: 0.240 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC ......: [B-VOP]...[]...[]...[]\n\nAudio Codec ...........: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: 97 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR audio\nInterleave ............: 40 ms\nNo. of audio streams ..: 1\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
