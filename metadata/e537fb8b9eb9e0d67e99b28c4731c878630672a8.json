You can change\n        many things in your PC but a hard disk needs a special treatment\n         because it keeps the most valuable ? your information. As any\n          important thing a hard disk requires your care. Giving some\n        consideration to it you are able to increase efficiency of your\n                                     work. \n\n        So, how can you optimize the disk system? A common problem that\n        often decreases the disk efficiency is non-optimal allocation of\n        files, the so-called file fragmentation is a process of storing\n          files on a hard disk, when file fragments are located so non\n         -optimally, that it leads to slow down read/write operations.\n       Usually it happens while updating files, when adjacent sectors are\n          occupied and the system writes updated fragments to farther\n        sectors. In this case the operating system spends more and more\n         time on search file fragments in different sectors of the disk\n       what causes problems decreasing the disk performance.. Under some\n        inevitable circumstances the system keeps fragments of a file in\n          different places of the disk, what significantly slows down\n       reading operations. To defragment files, it is sometimes necessary\n        to re-write them more compactly. It resembles threading beads ?\n         file fragments are gathering one by one, after that the system\n                   will spend less time on reading the file. \n\n       There are many solutions for the file fragmentation problem. Total\n        Defrag? is one of them. It is a reliable tool, which provides 27\n         defragmentation is a process of re-writing file fragments on a\n        hard disk in an optimal way, when they are locating so compactly\n       that the operating system spends less time on searching separated\n           fragments. The defragmentation procedure resolves the file\n          fragmentation problem. strategies and uses unique low-level\n         optimization algorithms. Despite the complicity of tasks Total\n        Defrag has an easy-to-use interface. Moreover the present manual\n           will help you to find the answers to many of the technical\n             questions, which might arise while using the program.\n\n\n\n            - No Key - No Bullshit -","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e537fb8b9eb9e0d67e99b28c4731c878630672a8","amp;dn":"Paragon+Total+Defrag+v2007+Retail+%5BF.O.S.I.%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e537fb8b9eb9e0d67e99b28c4731c878630672a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,55,251,139,158,185,224,214,126,153,178,140,71,49,200,120,99,6,114,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
