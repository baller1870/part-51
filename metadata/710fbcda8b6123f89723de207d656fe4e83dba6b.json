Our second game, working title: Robotology, is in development and will be released at some point.\n\nN received the Audience Choice award at the 2005 IGF awards, and the Audience Sparky at the 2006 Slamdance Guerilla Gamemaker Competition. Thanks to everyone who voted! You guys rock.\n\n\n\nWe are continually releasing tutorials, including source code, which cover the collision detection and simulation algorithms used in N.\n\n\n\n[Update regarding seeding: I seed to a ratio of 25:1, at which point I stop, I have to rely on others to, at worst, do a 1:1 to keep the torrent alive. If any of my torrents die, I WILL NOT re-upload/re-seed it. Don't hit and run. Thank you for your cooperation.]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:710fbcda8b6123f89723de207d656fe4e83dba6b","amp;dn":"%5C%27N%5C%27+Game+-+Freeware+Flying+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"710fbcda8b6123f89723de207d656fe4e83dba6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,15,188,218,139,97,35,248,151,35,222,32,125,101,111,228,232,61,186,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
