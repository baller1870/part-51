Rambo&amp;#039;s assignment is to only take pictures of where the POWs are being held, but Rambo wants to get the POWs out of Vietnam. Teamed up with female Vietnamese freedom fighter Co Bao, Rambo embarks on a mission to rescue the POWs, who are being held by sadistic Vietnamese Captain Vinh and his Russian comrade, Lieutenant Colonel Padovsky. Rambo falls in love with Co Bao, and when Co Bao is killed by Captain Vinh, Rambo wants revenge, so he starts killing every enemy in sight while still focusing on his intentions to rescue the POWs. There are also corrupt American officials involved in the mission, including Marshall Murdock, one of Rambo&amp;#039;s superiors.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91fb2558279ff21d9889519775239a8a9d4b410b","amp;dn":"Rambo%3A+First+Blood+Part+II+%281985%29+%5BH.264+Video+%2F+AAC+Audio+%2F+MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91fb2558279ff21d9889519775239a8a9d4b410b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,251,37,88,39,159,242,29,152,137,81,151,117,35,154,138,157,75,65,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
