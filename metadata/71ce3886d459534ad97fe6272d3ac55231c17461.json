We sing about pirates, and quests, and metal. But mostly pirates. The band was formed in 2004 by keyboard wizard Christopher Bowes and guitar shredmeister Gavin Harper, and got off to a pretty slow start. But eventually the first EP was released in April 2006, to universal cries of \\\\\\&quot;man, this is pure dos\\\\\\&quot;. \n\nAfter the success of the first EP a live Band was recruited. Initially taking in James Foote of Questioned by Theory who was unable to stay with the band due to University and duties with QBT. Soon after Dani Evans(Dragonforce to some) was recruited on Bass guitars and Gavin took up all the guitar duties himself. Doug Swierczek was recruited to take up the drums and the line up for the time was complete. This line up debuted on the 30th of June 2006 at the Balcony Bar in Dundee to a full(overlimit) house. They played another Co-Headlining show on the 21st of July for Comrade day with Self Made man, Dirty Wee Middens, Anitfaith(Shotgun Libido) and Aces High. \n\nThey closed off the \\\\\\&quot;We Came, We Saw, We Humped Yer Maw\\\\\\&quot; series of shows on the 8th of September back at the Balcony with a preview of the upcoming EP \\\\\\&quot;Terror on the High seas\\\\\\&quot;. This EP was released on the 11th of October and showed a much more developed sound with the tracks \\\\\\&quot;The Curse of Captain Morgan , Set Sail and Conquer, title track,Terror on the High Seas and Wenches and Mead\\\\\\&quot;. Album artwork was done by SiliconMessiah at UM.com. Big thanks to him. The bands line-up changed At the beginning of October with the addition of a good friend to the band Jason Heeny taking up bass guitar duites while Dani moves on to split the guitar duties with Gavin. This is the finalised line-up and it will debut sometime near the end of the year(dates still TBC). \n\nwww.battleheart.co.uk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71ce3886d459534ad97fe6272d3ac55231c17461","amp;dn":"Battleheart+-+Terror+On+The+High+Seas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71ce3886d459534ad97fe6272d3ac55231c17461","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,206,56,134,212,89,83,74,217,127,230,39,45,58,197,82,49,193,116,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
