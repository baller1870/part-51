My goal is to combine the elements of space and romance,\ncreating a delicate backdrop to the soul.? This is the philosophy that has\npropelled composer/producer Jonn Serrie to the forefront of the contemporary\ninstrumental and space music field. Serrie?s imaginative playing and visionary \ncompositional skills have revolutionized today?s contemporary electronic\nmusic. He creates a unique approach by combining the timelessness of space\nwith the exhilaration of love, all within the sanctuary of Planet Earth.\n\nSerrie?s premier release, And the Stars Go With You, is a journey into the\ndepths of deep space. He was later selected by the planetarium industry to\ncompose the music for NASA&amp;#039;s Teacher in Space program of the mid-80?s.\nSerrie?s recorded works include Century Seasons, Hidden World, Flightpath,\nTingri, compilation albums of music from his various planetarium projects\nentitled Planetary Chronicles Volume 1 and Volume 2, and many other fine\nworks. \n\nHis previous album, Epiphany, Meditations on Sacred Hymns, returns him\nto his spiritual and musical roots. The arrangements are soft and gentle, \nperfect for contemplative listening. In addition to compositions for What The\nBleep Do We Know!? and David Carradine?s Tai Chi series, Serrie has composed\nmusic for George Lucas and the Hayden Planetarium in New York City; PBS, the\nDiscovery Channel, the U.S. Navy Blue Angels, and created a unique presentation\nof educational narrative and live music with NASA astronaut Story Musgrave\ncalled ?Space Stories.? His music has been heard in London, Munich, Sweden,\nJapan, China, Canada, South America and Australia. He recently completed a\nproject with IMAX Corporation and the Space Telescope Science Institute on a\nfeature film about the discovery of Deep Field galaxies beyond the known\nuniverse. ?My music exists to help us explore a sense of ourselves and our\nplace in the universe?.\n\n- www.bleepstore.com\n\nPosting Policy:\n---------------\n  Please wait 3 days after the original post before asking for reposts.
