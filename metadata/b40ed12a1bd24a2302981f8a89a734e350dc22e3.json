The application will then automatically retrieve the latest information from various live data feeds on the Internet, and then present it to you.\n\n[System Requirements]\n32-bit Windows XP or 32-bit Windows VISTA\nPentium III processor or higher\n1024x768 screen resolution or higher\n128 MB RAM\n~20 MB hard disk space\nA broadband Internet connection (a dial-up connection is NOT recommended!)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b40ed12a1bd24a2302981f8a89a734e350dc22e3","amp;dn":"Earth+Alerts+6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b40ed12a1bd24a2302981f8a89a734e350dc22e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,14,209,42,27,210,74,35,2,152,31,138,137,167,52,227,80,220,34,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
