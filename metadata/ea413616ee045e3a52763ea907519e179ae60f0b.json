He soon helps her kill her abusive father (Rodney Dangerfield) and enabling mother (Edie McClurg), beginning their macabre journey down Route 666. Their M.O.: every few miles, they attack everyone within their site, invariably leaving only one person alive to tell the tale. The two are made famous by unscrupulous reporter Wayne Gale (Robert Downy jr.), as they run across the countryside, pursued by the equally sadistic Jack Scagnetti (Tom Sizemore). Just before the trial, a ratings-whoring interview by the same reporter who made them famous leads to pandemonium, not just within the prison itself, but nationwide. A satire of the media, public opinion, and the modern attitude toward violence. \n\n\nRipping/Editing/Encoding Info.: \n\n1) DVD Decrypter \n2) DVD Remaker \n3) DVD Rebuilder Pro (v1.12.1) &amp; CCE (SP2 v1.00.00.10) - 3 Pass \n\nAudio: English 5.1 DD / Director\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Comment 2.0 DD \nSubs: English, Portuguese (BR), Spanish, French \nMenu: YES (English) \nExtras: YES (25% Quality Drop on Extras) \nRipped: French 5.1, Warnings, Portuguese/Spanish Menu \nAdditional Notes: Region 4 Retail. \n\nReduction Level: 57,1% \nSpace for Video: 3.774.786KB \nOverall Bitrate: 3.145 Kbs \nHigh/Low/Typical Bitrates: 4.012/1.338/2.516 Kbs \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------//--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n!!!
