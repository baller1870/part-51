Yes, a live-cd running Debian Lenny. It took me quite a while to find and download a working iso, and when I did it took a bazillion million years for the silly thing to download... alioth server was running slow that day or just overloaded, don&amp;#039;t know don&amp;#039;t care. So, here it is so others may get it out there and use it. I have found this to be an excellent repair disk, forensic tool, or just to goof around and be able to have a fully working Debian Lenny up and running on your lamer friend&amp;#039;s (who of course runs windows..) machine, have a portable OS that is very secure and leaves no evidence of its existence when you reboot. Apt-get and all the goodness of Debian exist on here.
