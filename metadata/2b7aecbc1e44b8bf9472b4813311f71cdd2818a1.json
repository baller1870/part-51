Judge Reinhold reprises his role as Det.

Originally estimated at $55 million, it was soon in excess of $70 million. Of that budget, $15 million was Eddie Murphy&amp;#039;s paycheck.\n\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109254/\n\nVideoCaps: http://img178.imageshack.us/img178/8356/capslh8.jpg\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b7aecbc1e44b8bf9472b4813311f71cdd2818a1","amp;dn":"Beverly+Hills+Cop+Trilogy+%28DVD-RIP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b7aecbc1e44b8bf9472b4813311f71cdd2818a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,122,236,188,30,68,184,191,148,114,180,129,51,17,247,28,221,40,24,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
