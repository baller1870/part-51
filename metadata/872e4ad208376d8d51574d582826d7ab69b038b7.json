The software offers the same playability and functionality as the company?s Pro DJ products, using a PC instead of two CDJ turntables and a DJ mixer.\nThe DJS software also has a ripping function for converting CD, line input signals and wave files to .mp3.\n\nThe graphic user interface is intuitive and easy to understand. It follows the same ergonomic design used in all Pioneer CDJ products and mixers. The display shows everything a professional DJ needs to see, including: time, BPM, mixer controls, jog dial, hot cue buttons, etc.\n\nThe DJ can assign basic functions to a particular key on the PC keyboard. By doing this for frequently used functions, the DJ can establish his or her own playing style ? on a keyboard. In addition, the sync feature automatically beat matches the cued track to the track that is playing and a powerful effects program mimics the effector features of the DJM600.\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n\nMicrosoftÃ‚Â® WindowsÃ‚Â® XP Home Edition/Microsoft Windows XP Professional/ Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional &amp;#56256;&amp;#56451; IntelÃ‚Â® PentiumÃ‚Â®M (or a comparable processor at 1.5 GHz or faster)\n512 MB RAM or more\nScreen resolution of 1024 X 768 pixels or better\nBuilt-in or external audio output\nDVD or CD-ROM drive\n250 MB or more of free hard disk space (excluding the capacity needed for storing .mp3 and other files)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:872e4ad208376d8d51574d582826d7ab69b038b7","amp;dn":"Pioneer.SVJDL01.DJ.Trial.with.Crack.ASBO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"872e4ad208376d8d51574d582826d7ab69b038b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,46,74,210,8,55,109,141,81,87,77,88,40,38,215,171,105,176,56,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
