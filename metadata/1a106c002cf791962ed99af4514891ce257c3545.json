Dracula, freed at last from a century in confinement, finds himself in a 21st century of chaos and temptation, of Virgin record stores and subterranean nightclubs, where he fits right in. His first destination is the United States the ultimate location for his charismatic seductions of beautiful young women and his unceasing quest for power but there is another reason he has come here. Somewhere in New Orleans is a young woman Dracula must find... the only person on earth with whom he truly shares his dark legacy.\n\n\nOther features\nInteractive Menus, Scene Access \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a106c002cf791962ed99af4514891ce257c3545","amp;dn":"DRACULA_2001+%28Wes+Craven%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a106c002cf791962ed99af4514891ce257c3545","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,16,108,0,44,247,145,150,46,217,154,244,81,72,145,206,37,124,53,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
