Even brand new systems from major\nmanufacturers can have hidden flaws.  If any of several key components such\nas CPU, memory, cooling, etc. are not up to spec, it can lead to incorrect\ncalculations and/or unexplained system crashes.\n\nOverclocking is the practice of increasing the speed of the CPU and/or\nmemory to make a machine faster at little cost.  Typically, overclocking\ninvolves pushing a machine past its limits and then backing off just a\nlittle bit.\n\nFor these reasons, both non-overclockers and overclockers need programs\nthat test the stability of their computers.  This is done by running\nprograms that put a heavy load on the computer.  Though not originally\ndesigned for this purpose, this program is one of a few programs that\nare excellent at stress testing a computer.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbd7bc602bd0672d16406b0605c601b081300bf3","amp;dn":"Prime95+v+2414","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbd7bc602bd0672d16406b0605c601b081300bf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,215,188,96,43,208,103,45,22,64,107,6,5,198,1,176,129,48,11,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
