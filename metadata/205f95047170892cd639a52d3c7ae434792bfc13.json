DRE with three bangers from the dynamic duo. This\nclassic pairing marks the duo&amp;#039;s first collaborative effort in approximately five\nyears and promises to make history once again.\n\n&quot;Tha Blue Carpet Treatment&quot; is a return to the original sound that put the Long\nBeach rapper on the map with Snoop keeping it gangsta on each and every record.\nFollowing the street single, &quot;Vato,&quot; produced by PHARRELL and featuring B-REAL,\ncomes the highly anticipated second single, &quot;That&amp;#039;s That&quot; produced by NOTTZ and\nfeaturing R&amp;B crooner R. KELLY. This catchy and melodic song was most added at\nUrban and Rhythmic formats, proving it is shaping up to be another platinum hit\nfor the West Coast &quot;Boss.&quot; Snoop says, &quot;&amp;#039;That&amp;#039;s That&amp;#039; is theme music for a\nclassy gangsta party - that&amp;#039;s when you ladies pull out the high heels and the\nplayas pull out the three-piece suits. You&amp;#039;ll see in the video! Me and R. KELLY\nhad a lot of fun shooting this one.&quot;\n\nThroughout the album, Snoop takes it back to the hood showcasing the gritty\nrealness that helped shape his status as a cultural icon. XXL writes, &quot;Snoop&amp;#039;s\nlyrical fire seems resurrected, as he delivers arguably his most consistently\nscorching work post-Doggystyle.&quot; Thirsty fans will be thrilled with the thought\nprovoking song &quot;Imagine,&quot; produced by and featuring DR. DRE, which reflects on\nwhat life would be like for the California natives without hip hop. The\nsignature DR. DRE piano riff is complimented by the D&amp;#039;ANGELO sung chorus,\nmarking the first time fans have heard D&amp;#039;ANGELO in six long years. Another album\nfavorite is club banger &quot;Psst,&quot; produced by JAMIE FOXX, N8 and BRAINZ and\nfeatures JAMIE FOXX&amp;#039;s signature falsetto on the hook. The album also features\ntwo collaborations with AKON, &quot;Boss&amp;#039;s Life&quot; produced by DR. DRE and the current\nradio smash &quot;I Wanna Love You,&quot; the latter also being on AKON&amp;#039;s upcoming album.\nOf the album, Snoop says, &quot;Tha Blue Carpet Treatment is my presentation to the\nworld on what it means to be the King of the West Coast. I really worked extra\nhard on making this one perfect and got the best of the best among my homies in\nthe music game- SKATEBOARD P, TIMBALAND, R. KELLY, D&amp;#039;ANGELO... and you know when\nme and DR. DRE get together - it&amp;#039;s a monster.&quot;\n\nAs a gift to loyal fans, Snoop is treating 9 winners to &quot;Tha Blue Carpet\nTreatment.&quot; Nine winning tickets will be placed inside random CDs of the album\nwhich reward the lucky recipient with a diamond Ice link watch. The grand prize\nwinner will win a diamond Ice Link watch worth $100,000. Three winners will be\nprized with diamond Ice Link watches worth $10,000 and five winners will get\ndiamond Ice Link watches worth $5,000.\n\nAs if Snoop were not busy enough, he also recently released his first book,\n&quot;Love Don&amp;#039;t Live Here No More,&quot; a story loosely based on his own life&amp;#039;s trials\nand tribulations. The book, co-written by playwright David E. Talbert, is the\nfirst in a series of novels called Doggy Tales that takes readers from the\nunforgiving streets of Long Beach to the bright lights of show business.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:205f95047170892cd639a52d3c7ae434792bfc13","amp;dn":"Snoop_Dogg-Tha_Blue_CarpeTreatment-2006-RNS-REALRAPTALK.COM.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"205f95047170892cd639a52d3c7ae434792bfc13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,95,149,4,113,112,137,44,214,57,165,45,60,122,228,52,121,43,252,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
