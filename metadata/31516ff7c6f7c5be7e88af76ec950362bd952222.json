Incase you have installed the Genuine Windows Notification update muBlinder allows you to get rid of those nagging popups.\n\nIn addition, muBlinder can help you install applications that contain WGA protection with the use of external blinders (plugin patches). You can even create your blinders for others to use!\n\nmuBlinder does not need to be installed and can be placed on a floppy disk or flash memory stick. Just unzip to a folder of your choice and run it. For removal, simply delete the muBlinder.exe file and the associated DLL.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.p2plife.com/forums/Official_muBlinder_Page-t320.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.p2plife.com/forums/Official_muBlinder_Page-t320.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31516ff7c6f7c5be7e88af76ec950362bd952222","amp;dn":"muBlinder+3.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31516ff7c6f7c5be7e88af76ec950362bd952222","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,81,111,247,198,247,197,190,126,136,175,118,236,149,3,98,189,149,34,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
