He lives \n             with Bronx-born Intel analyst Trudy (Naomie Harris), as they \n             work undercover transporting drug loads into South Florida to \n             identify a group responsible for three murders. Sonny Crockett \n             (Colin Farrell) [to the untrained eye, his presentation may seem \n             unorthodox, but procedurally, he is sound] is charismatic and \n             flirtatious until - while undercover working with the supplier of \n             the South Florida group - he gets romantically entangled with Isabella \n             (Gong Li), the Chinese-Cuban wife of an arms and drugs trafficker. \n             The best undercover identity is oneself with the volume turned up and \n             restraint unplugged. The intensity of the case pushes Crockett and         Tubbs \n             out onto the edge where identity and fabrication become blurred, where \n             cop and player become one - especially for Crockett in his romance       \nwith \n             Isabella and for Tubbs in the provocation of an assault on those he loves.\n                                 \n                Aspect Ratio / Widescreen\n                Audio        / English 5.1\n                Video        / Encoded @ 8 passes\n                Menu         / Untouched\n                Extras       / Stripped\n                Subtitles    / English, Dutch, french, magyar, danish , suomi, norsk\n                swedish, hebrew","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fbced6f89dfd98411b0c0ba1d4755358c659ab6","amp;dn":"Miami.Vice.PAL.DVDR-BAVARiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fbced6f89dfd98411b0c0ba1d4755358c659ab6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,188,237,111,137,223,217,132,17,176,192,186,29,71,85,53,140,101,154,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
