This release as always is recorded with Easy cd-da Extractor, only thing that has changed is i decided to go with my old favorite encoder, wav-pack. I feel overall it&amp;#039;s best for all types of music. This was encoded from original disc, NOT a re-copy from previous download files. I guess i&amp;#039;m a bit of an ass when it comes to audio quality. I hope you all enjoy this disc. Comments are welcomed and wanted, good or bad. Thanks and i hope you enjoy this old release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4f1ad747c77225c770bd0585a6ce461c00498a6","amp;dn":"Mary+J.+Blige+-+What%5C%27s+The+411","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4f1ad747c77225c770bd0585a6ce461c00498a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,241,173,116,124,119,34,92,119,11,208,88,90,108,228,97,192,4,152,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
