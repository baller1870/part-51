I just want my life back!? Suddenly, a swarm of United States Border Patrol SUVs roll up behind them. Over a loud speaker, and officer orders Mahone to drop the weapon. Mahone calls out that he is with the FBI, but the officer doesn?t care and orders Mahone to drop his weapon. After some thought, Mahone complies, and the Border Patrol moves in.\n\nAbove the U.S. and Mexico border, Sucre and the pilot race towards their destination. However, the DEA has sent a plane after them and hails them over the radio. The pilot tells Sucre that Border Patrol is on them, but it?s too late to land the plane.

He asks one of the men where he might be able to get a similar hand.
