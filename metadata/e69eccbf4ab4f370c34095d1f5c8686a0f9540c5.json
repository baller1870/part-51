Matriculation has its rewards, apparently, and it&amp;#039;s time to take stock. Lyrically, there&amp;#039;s plenty of self-congratulation to attend to, but the real fun comes in the collabs, and West chooses co-conspirators like a kid in a candy store--John Legend (&quot;Good Life&quot;), Coldplay&amp;#039;s Chris Martin (&quot;Homecoming&quot;), Mos Def and the Section Quartet (both adorable choices for the foreboding &quot;Drunk and Hot Girls&quot;)--and plucks samples with A-list braggadocio: Elton John, Steely Dan, Daft Punk, Can, Michael Jackson, Public Enemy. Nothing here quite captures the superlative symbiosis of West&amp;#039;s past best beats (think &quot;Gold Digger&quot;), but the central motif remains: No one ever accused Kanye West of being too cool for school, and Graduation still knows how to party. True, Kanye West will happily whine about the pitfalls at the top of the heap, clear his throat and try to rhyme it with Barry Bonds, or diss fish in a barrel all day, but that can&amp;#039;t stop a shameless good time, and Graduation maintains an unshakeable knack for producing it. --Jason Kirk  \n\n1.
