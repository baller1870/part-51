That alone would make it worth coveting for his fans, but beyond that \nit is a damn fine album. Try as current artists may, including Shreeve himself, \nto duplicate the analog synthesizer sound of the 1970s, there is a spirit to \nthe original recordings from that era that cannot be copied. This is the genuine \narticle, and it is a wonderful treasure.\nThe album is divided into four long electronic excursions. \n&quot;Thoughts of War - Part One&quot; is a full-blown sequencer attack that impresses as \nmuch today as it must have then. There are two distinct movements within the 15-\nminute song, titled &quot;Escalation&quot; and &quot;Cold Emotion.&quot; The latter takes the same \nsequencer pattern, strips away the surrounding electronics, and adds some heavy \nmodulation to make the music sound colder to fit the mood. This is a great \nthematic work, incredible storytelling without words. &quot;Nightmare of Reality&quot; \nshould appeal greatly to fans of early 1970s Klaus Schulze. &quot;Dream Sequence&quot; is \nfascinating to listen to as it unfolds. Largely a mood piece, it takes a \nsurprising, more upbeat turn toward the end. It&amp;#039;s clear that Shreeve was painting a picture with this music, the soundtrack to a movie of his imagination. It is energetic but moody, with a sense of foreboding.\n&quot;Thoughts of War&quot; has all the right elements in the right combinations - great sounds, great emotion, thoughtful compositions, all arranged in a way that is familiar yet thoroughly original. Surprisingly, it is currently only available as a limited edition of 300 copies. If they sell out, hopefully plans will be made for a second reissue of more copies to follow.\n\n2000.
