Many tools that are often marketed as advanced or for professional use are actually only more expensive consumer applications with pre-cooked DVD structure and questionable user interface. \n\nDVD-lab PRO is based on the idea of original DVD-lab. Instead of insulting the users with an overdone flashy interface, DVD-lab and DVD-lab PRO put strong emphasis on the usability of it. The Modern Windows GUI can be tweaked and reorganized to everybody taste even across multiple monitors.\n\nDVD-lab PRO is also one of the very few applications on the market that grows with your requirements and knowledge. Users of other applications usually either outgrow them very soon or they need to study a long time before they are able to create even simple project. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16e59ab13610c39194d604d9a07d8823b914ee43","amp;dn":"Mediachance+DVDLabPro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16e59ab13610c39194d604d9a07d8823b914ee43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,229,154,177,54,16,195,145,148,214,4,217,160,125,136,35,185,20,238,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
