Also works on players from the US and Australia.\n\nThe most likely need to already have the 2.5 firmware installed to work.\n\nSome also might need to install the 2.7 firmware from disc after installing this, some have reported problems with firmware update direct from the player, because this is the australian firmware. After intalling 2.7 from disc, there should not be any more problems with using the update directly from the players.\n\n\nFor those with 2.7 already innstalled, use this file to set the firmware back to 2.5: http://www.mediafire.com/?7idwgjn1tgd (I have not tried this)\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfac84450f2afacd9c4e9057d06580afb8c78158","amp;dn":"Region+Free+firmware+for+Toshiba+HD+DVD+Players+E1%2C+EP10+and+XE1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfac84450f2afacd9c4e9057d06580afb8c78158","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,172,132,69,15,42,250,205,156,78,144,87,208,101,128,175,184,199,129,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
