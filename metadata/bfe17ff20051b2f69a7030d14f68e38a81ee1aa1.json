Notable for its strong continuity, complex characters and unexpected plot twists, it chronicles the adventures of two dopey teenage boys, Hank and Dean Venture; their super-scientist father, Dr. Thaddeus \\\\\\&quot;Rusty\\\\\\&quot; Venture; and their family\\\\\\&amp;#039;s bodyguard, secret agent Brock Samson.\n\nThe series pays homage to the style of the classic Hanna-Barbera action series Jonny Quest. Hank and Dean\\\\\\&amp;#039;s roles resemble those of Jonny and Hadji, Dr. Venture is a caricature of Dr. Benton Quest, and Brock Samson presents a testosterone-loaded, excessively violent take on Race Bannon, who has appeared in the show. Flashbacks show that Dr. Venture was like Jonny Quest in his youth, and his own father was a more traditional \\\\\\&quot;Dr. Quest\\\\\\&quot;. The show also parodies The Hardy Boys mysteries and comic book superheroes.\n\nSeason three is set to begin in winter 2007-2008.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfe17ff20051b2f69a7030d14f68e38a81ee1aa1","amp;dn":"Adult+Swim+Venture+Bros+-+Season+1%2CSeason+2+and+mp3%2C+wallpaper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfe17ff20051b2f69a7030d14f68e38a81ee1aa1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,225,127,242,0,81,178,246,154,112,48,209,79,104,227,138,129,238,26,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
