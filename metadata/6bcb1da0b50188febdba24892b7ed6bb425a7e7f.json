Casey has the ability to throw super-fast balls that cannot be hit. Eventually, the National League finds out and rules that Casey must be taken off the team because he isn&amp;#039;t human. Casey&amp;#039;s inventor gives him a heart to have him classified as human. Now that Casey has human emotions, he refuses to throw his fast balls anymore. He says that he feels empathy with the batter and does not want to ruin the batter?s career by striking him out. With the team sure to fold soon, the coach and the scientist set off to create an entire pitching staff of Casey robots.\n\nMP4 format for your IPOD\n\nPLEASE SEED! \n\nEnjoy! \n\nAntil0ck\n\n_______       ______________________      ______  \n___    |________  /___(_)__  /_  __ ________  /__\n__  /| |_  __   __/_  /__  /_  / / /  ___/_  //_/\n_  ___ |  / / / /_ _  / _  / / /_/ // /__ _  ,&lt;   \n/_/  |_/_/ /_/__/ /_/  /_/  ____/ ___/ /_/|_| ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bcb1da0b50188febdba24892b7ed6bb425a7e7f","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+Episode+35-+The+Mighty+Casey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bcb1da0b50188febdba24892b7ed6bb425a7e7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,203,29,160,181,1,136,254,189,186,36,137,43,126,214,187,66,90,126,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
