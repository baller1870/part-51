Length : 138min                     \n\n\n After returning to Hogwarts to begin his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry       \n Potter discovers that much of the wizarding world, including the Ministry    \n of Magic, is in denial about Lord Voldemort&amp;#039;s return. The Order of the       \n Phoenix, a group sworn against Voldemort, is using its vast array of         \n wizards and witches magical abilities to combat Voldemort. Cornelius Fudge,  \n Minister for Magic, suspects that Dumbledore is using these claims of The    \n Dark Lord&amp;#039;s return as a means to over-throw Fudge as Minister. In            \n retaliation, a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher is appointed by     \n the Ministry in order to keep an eye on Hogwarts. This new teacher,          \n Professor Umbridge, implies strict new teachings and rules, forcing a group  \n of students, under the tutelage of Harry, to form a club, by the name of     \n Dumbledore&amp;#039;s Army                                                            ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4f1a5baf0ced31106d990b0896aa67ebfdf2f4e","amp;dn":"Harry+Potter+and+the+Order+Of+The+Phoenix.WS.2007.XviD.HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4f1a5baf0ced31106d990b0896aa67ebfdf2f4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,241,165,186,240,206,211,17,6,217,144,176,137,106,166,126,191,223,47,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
