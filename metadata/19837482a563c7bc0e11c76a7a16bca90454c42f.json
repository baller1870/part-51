Due to the Japanese standards of audio mastering, some would say this is the best available version of ..and Justice For All. We aren\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;t fortunate to have a DCC version of this album so this is the cosest we will get. I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;ve compared this to the Elektra release and have noticed a higher level of clarity in this version. Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;t take my word for it. Hear for yourself.\n\nthanks goes to the original uploader!
