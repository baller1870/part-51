Early \n        in the battle, an American flag is raised atop the high point,\n        Mount Suribachi, and a photograph of the raising becomes an \n        American cause celebre. As a powerful inspiration to war-sick \n        Americans, the photo becomes a symbol of the Allied cause. The \n        three surviving flag raisers, Rene Gagnon, John Bradley, and \n        Ira Hayes, are whisked back to civilization to help raise funds \n        for the war effort. But the accolades for heroism heaped upon the\n        three men are at odds with their own personal realizations that \n        thousands of real heroes lie dead on Iwo Jima, and that their \n        own contributions to the fight are only symbolic and not deserving\n        of the singling out they are experiencing. Each of the three must \n        come to terms with the honors, exploitation, and grief that they \n        face simply for being in a photograph.\n\n\n                             \n\n        ----------------------------- NOTES ---------------------------\n\n\n        Notes: This movie is Transcoded to work with Sonys PSP handheld\n               MP4 format.
