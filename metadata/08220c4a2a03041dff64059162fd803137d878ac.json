After the fall of Rome, visionary warlord Marke (Rufus Sewell) seeks to unite the squabbling English tribes to form one strong nation and defeat brutal Irish King Donnchadh. But when Lord Marke&amp;#039;s greatest and most loyal knight, Tristan (James Franco), falls in love with Isolde (Sophia Myles), a beautiful Irish woman, it threatens to destroy the fragile truce and ignite a war. In the spirit of Braveheart and A Knights Tale, Tristan &amp; Isolde is a rousing tale of trust and treachery that will leave you breathless!\n\n\nAUDIO......[ 48000Hz 448kb/s 5.1ch\nVIDEO......[ 1080 kbps 2-pass XviD\nRESOLUTION.[ 640 x 344\nSOURCE.....[ NTSC WS DVD\nIMDB LINK..[ http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375154/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08220c4a2a03041dff64059162fd803137d878ac","amp;dn":"Tristan+%26+Isolde+-+DVDRip+XviD+AC3+5.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08220c4a2a03041dff64059162fd803137d878ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,34,12,74,42,3,4,29,255,100,5,145,98,253,128,49,55,216,120,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
