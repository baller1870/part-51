Bush defied his critics and has authorized more \ntroops for Iraq - the so-called &quot;surge&quot;. This week, Brian goes to the U.S. \ncapital to look closely at what lies behind this strategy and whether it \ncan bring stability to the shattered country, especially its violent and \nunstable capital, Baghdad. In Washington, Brian talks to several leading \nobservers about failing optimism in the Iraq campaign, among them, the \nrespected U.S. military and strategic analyst, Anthony Cordesman of the \nCenter for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nOur World also brings you a story about the latest group of U.S. soldiers \nheading for Iraq. The CBC&amp;#039;s Neil Macdonald travels to Georgia to talk to \nsoldiers and their families about the government&amp;#039;s decision to send more \ntroops. The soldiers in Neil&amp;#039;s report, who are from Fort Stewart, know what \nit&amp;#039;s like to pay the price of combat. One in ten of the soldiers who&amp;#039;ve died \nin Iraq came from Fort Stewart.\n\nFinally, Brian explores the role U.S. civilian administrators have played in \nIraq. Most of the attention has been focused on the U.S. military. But U.S. \ncivilian advisors and administrators have played a critical role in how the \nU.S. occupation has unfolded. Brian speaks to Rajiv Chandrasekaran of the \nWashington Post about the sometimes-surprising policies put in place by \ncivilian decision-makers. Chandrasekaran has written a highly regarded book \non the subject. It&amp;#039;s called &quot;Imperial Life in the Emerald City&quot;.  It&amp;#039;s a \nfascinating look inside the &quot;Green Zone&quot;, the heavily protected and lavish \nneighbourhood of  the U.S. civilian force, a community that lives in relative \nsafety, strangely remote from the violent city outside.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bcef181df8a710f3cb84fb08d8d88edc1e9997b","amp;dn":"Washingtons+Winter+Of+Discontent+%282007%29+CBC+-+Our+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bcef181df8a710f3cb84fb08d8d88edc1e9997b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,206,241,129,223,138,113,15,60,184,79,176,141,141,136,237,193,233,153,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
