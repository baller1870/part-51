I like Baltimore club more than most, but after listening to it for an hour straight, I feel like I should be assembling computer parts or something. But LB ain\\&amp;#039;t gonna do you that way. This almost plays like a hip-hop mix except with the B-More beats. He starts it off with a section of versioned club hits including \\&quot;Never Scared, Tear Da Club Off, Milkshake, Tipsy, Yeah, 99 Problems, Hard Knock Life, She Wants To Move\\&quot; and more. Then he moves into the novelty section with tracks like \\&quot;Big Dummy\\&quot; (Sanford and Son), \\&quot;Uncle Fucker\\&quot; (South Park), \\&quot;Rick James Bitch,\\&quot; and \\&quot;Spongebob.\\&quot; He ends with short section of classics, including the holy trinity of \\&quot;Put Ya Leg Up, Whores in the House,\\&quot; and \\&quot;Doo Doo Brown.\\&quot; The mixing and timing here is impeccable, what you\\&amp;#039;d expect from Hollertronix. This makes a bold attempt at being the only Baltimore mix you will ever buy in your lifetime.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3702a8e634b9080349146be6210de496f0148ea1","amp;dn":"Low+Budget+Pawrty+Music+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3702a8e634b9080349146be6210de496f0148ea1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,2,168,230,52,185,8,3,73,20,107,230,33,13,228,150,240,20,142,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
