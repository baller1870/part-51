Cora Corman\n\nCheery Alex Fletcher lives comfortably in Manhattan off the residuals from his 80&amp;#039;s pop success and reprising his hits at school reunions, theme parks, and state fairs. But those gigs are declining, so he jumps at the chance to write a song and record it with reigning teen idol Cora Corman. Trouble is, he&amp;#039;s good at melodies but needs a lyricist and has less than a week to finish. Enter Sophie Fisher, subbing for a friend who waters Alex&amp;#039;s plants; she&amp;#039;s a pretty good poet, quick witted, and could do it, if she&amp;#039;d agree. But there&amp;#039;s some sort of shadow over her head that Alex may not be able to charm his way past. And what if they do get a song written, what then?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f7ef508b4790246e71be120e54458359f6b5e34","amp;dn":"Music+and+Lyrics+%282007%29+++%28eng%2Fesp%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f7ef508b4790246e71be120e54458359f6b5e34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,126,245,8,180,121,2,70,231,27,225,32,229,68,88,53,159,107,94,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
