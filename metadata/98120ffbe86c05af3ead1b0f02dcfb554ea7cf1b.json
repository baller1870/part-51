They do this to stop the widespread use of pirated telecines \n(which were once very common).  Lately however there has been very few real \ntelecines, most of the scene telecines you see are actually R5 retails.  \nR5 retail is rushed out by the studio, they are basically competing with \npirates, so there is little to no cleanup of the film after the telecine \nprocess.  So the main difference between telecines put out by the pirates is\nthat the r5&amp;#039;s are done using pro equipment, professional studios and \nprofessional people.  The quality of R5 retail is very similar to dvdscr&amp;#039;s,\n no time is usually spent cleaning up dvdscrs either.\n\nThe range of  quality we now have is like this.\nR1/2 retail &gt; DVDSCR &gt; R5 Retail &gt; Telecine &gt; Telesync &gt; Cam.  \nVhs scr and wps, come around the ts mark (obviously differs between rls).\n\nWe will be tagging future releases as follows:\n\nTag: R5   Example:  Moviename.R5.format-group\n\nDescription: Any R5 retail with english audio will be tagged as this.  \nIn the past R5 with english audio has been wrong tagged as, \nTC (ex: The.Departed.PROPER.READ.NFO.TC.XviD-ZN), DVDSCR \n(ex: Trust.The.Man.LiMiTED.DVDSCR.DVDR-BOOM) and DVDRip \n(ex: The.Matador.2005.DVDRiP.XviD-HLS).  \nWe want to cut this bullshit, and just tag as R5, not as dvdrip, \njust a new category:  R5.\n\nTag: R5.LINE   Example: Moviename.R5.LINE.format-group\n\nAny R5 retail, which hasn&amp;#039;t got english audio will be synced to DIRECT \nenglish audio and tagged as R5.LINE.  In the past these have been \ntagged as TC (ex: Crank.TC.XviD-ZN) and DVDSCR\n(ex: Ice.Age.2.The.Meltdown.DVDSCR.XViD-DaNK).\n\nTag: TC  Example Moviename.TC.format-group\n\nAny illegally produced non studio telecine, should be tagged TC.  \n\nBasically we are sick of whats happening, somebody has to make a stand,\njust look at the whole pirates of the caribbean mess!\n\nDREAMLiGHT\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98120ffbe86c05af3ead1b0f02dcfb554ea7cf1b","amp;dn":"Borat.R5.LINE.PROPER.XViD-PUKKA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98120ffbe86c05af3ead1b0f02dcfb554ea7cf1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,18,15,251,232,108,5,175,62,173,27,15,2,220,251,85,78,167,207,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
