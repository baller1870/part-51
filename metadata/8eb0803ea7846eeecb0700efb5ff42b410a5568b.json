(with homebrew subtitle in English)\n\nOn April 6th in 1945, a Japanese \\&amp;#039;Yamato\\&amp;#039;, the largest battle ship in the WW2 period, leaved its home port \\&amp;#039;Kure\\&amp;#039; and moved forward for Okinawa. The last mission of \\&amp;#039;Yamato\\&amp;#039; and its 3,000 crew was a Kamikaze attack against the U.S. Armed Forces just landed in the small island located in the south end of Japan.\nThe day after, \\&amp;#039;Yamato\\&amp;#039; became the largest target for firing practice about 200 miles north of Okinawa. \\&amp;#039;Yamato\\&amp;#039; didn\\&amp;#039;t have any guardian aircrafts.....crazy!\nIts end was tragical, as you know, a tragedy is a comedy sometimes. More than 90% of the crew, most of them were teenagers, were killed or drowned.\n\nMore info about \\&amp;#039;Yamato\\&amp;#039;; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Yamato&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Yamato&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8eb0803ea7846eeecb0700efb5ff42b410a5568b","amp;dn":"Otoko+Tachi+No+Yamato+2005+-+AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8eb0803ea7846eeecb0700efb5ff42b410a5568b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,176,128,62,167,132,110,238,203,7,0,239,181,255,66,180,16,165,86,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
