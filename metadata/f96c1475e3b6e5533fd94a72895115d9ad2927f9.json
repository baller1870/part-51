So far, however, this part has only been released. Furthermore, I wanted to point out that this is\na rip from GoogleVideo (http://video.google.com/) but the overall quality is still very good unlike those flash movies you see on such sites. \n\nCreds to all seeders out there! :)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPrograms/Processes: GoogleVideo -&gt; KeepVid.com -&gt; SUPER\nPlaying time      : 01:30:41\nLanguage          : English (no subtitle)\nAudio Description : 128kbps / MPEG Layer-3\nVideo Description : 23 fps  / 23 bit (video sample size)\nWebSite #1        : http://www.911weknow.com/\nWebSite #2        : http://www.911weknow.com/index.php?option=com_contact&amp;Itemid=2\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n90 minutes of pure demolition evidence and analysis, laced with staggering witness testimonials. Moving from &quot;the myth&quot; through &quot;the analysis&quot; and into &quot;the players,&quot; careful deconstruction of the official story set right alongside clean, clear science.  The 9/11 picture is not one of politics or nationalism or loyalty, but one of strict and simple physics.  How do you get a 10-second 110-story pancake collapse?\n\nA movie that might actually reach our complacent mainstream. No agenda. No finger-pointing. Just the facts and the &quot;mysteries.&quot; Look at that. Think about this. A story of people: Willie Rodriguez&amp;#039;s strange recollection of noises on the 34th floor. Who was up there, bumping around? Scott Forbes&amp;#039; similar story, weeks before the towers fell. A story of blasting itself. Here&amp;#039;s how shaped charges slice through steel beams to control the way they fall.\n\nPART 1: DEMOLITIONS\nTall buildings shatter in 10 seconds, steel beams buckle as if crushed by Superman. A volcano of ash darkens the sky. Can jet fuel perform such a feat?\n\nPART 2: HIJACKERS &amp; PLANES (To come)\nA 757 dives into the Pentagon, penetrating to its core. Invisible Arabs hijack airplanes, passengers make history and untraceable phone calls. ?Elementary, my dear Watson. Let?s roll.?\n\nPART 3: WHO BENEFITS (To come)\nStock trades and civil rights go haywire. An empire is born as citizens enjoy the perfect Big Sleep. Bogart did say, ?All you owe the public is a good performance.? But who?s backstage?\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f96c1475e3b6e5533fd94a72895115d9ad2927f9","amp;dn":"9%2F11+Mysteries+%28Full+Length%2C+High+Quality%29+%5BDivX_2006%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f96c1475e3b6e5533fd94a72895115d9ad2927f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,108,20,117,227,182,229,83,63,217,74,114,137,81,21,217,173,41,39,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
