Ripped using a Plextor Drive (best for pure DAE), with EAC in Secure mode, encoded in Q6 (~192kbps) Ogg Vorbis.  Tags are verified to be exactly as printed on the CDs, unlike the shitty ones provided by the likes of iTunes and others*.  Please, as always support the artists.\n\n* - One of the bonus tracks is named \\\\\\&quot;Bangers + Mash\\\\\\&quot;.  Itunes tags it \\\\\\&quot;Bangers &amp; Mash\\\\\\&quot;, and in other places it\\\\\\&amp;#039;s called \\\\\\&quot;Bangers and Mash\\\\\\&quot;.  It\\\\\\&amp;#039;s a little difference, perhaps, but if you\\\\\\&amp;#039;re a user of such services as Last.FM, it\\\\\\&amp;#039;s important to get the little things right.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bd4407e5683208a31ff272034e30b3c6c57595d","amp;dn":"Radiohead+-+In+Rainbows+%282007%29+2-CD+Set+%28Ogg-Vorbis%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bd4407e5683208a31ff272034e30b3c6c57595d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,212,64,126,86,131,32,138,49,255,39,32,52,227,11,60,108,87,89,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
