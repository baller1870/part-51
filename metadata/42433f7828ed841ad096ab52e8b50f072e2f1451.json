One of them, Marcusson, is a positive thinker who believes that people are alike all over, even on the Red Planet. The other astronaut, Conrad, has a more cynical view of human interplanetary nature. The impact of landing on Mars is so severe that Marcusson dies. Now alone, Conrad is consumed by fear when he hears a rhythmic sound reverberating upon the ship&amp;#039;s hull. Expecting some unnameable evil, he finds his apprehension turning to joy when, upon opening the hatch, he sees Martians that indeed appear human, have mind-reading abilities and give the impression of being most amicable, especially the beautiful Teenya, who welcomes and reassures him.

Conrad briefly relaxes, but soon discovers that his room is windowless and the doors cannot be opened. Momentarily, a wall slides upward, leading to Conrad&amp;#039;s realization that he has become a caged exhibit in a Martian zoo. In the episode&amp;#039;s closing lines, Conrad yells to the heavens addressing Marcusson by name, &quot;You were right! People are alike...people are alike all over...&quot;\n\nMP4 Format for your IPOD\n\nPLEASE SEED! \n\nEnjoy! \n\nAntil0ck\n\n\n_______       ______________________      ______  \n___    |________  /___(_)__  /_  __ ________  /__\n__  /| |_  __   __/_  /__  /_  / / /  ___/_  //_/\n_  ___ |  / / / /_ _  / _  / / /_/ // /__ _  ,&lt;   \n/_/  |_/_/ /_/__/ /_/  /_/  ____/ ___/ /_/|_| \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42433f7828ed841ad096ab52e8b50f072e2f1451","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+Episode+25-+People+are+alike+all+over","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42433f7828ed841ad096ab52e8b50f072e2f1451","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,67,63,120,40,237,132,26,208,150,171,82,232,181,15,7,46,47,20,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
