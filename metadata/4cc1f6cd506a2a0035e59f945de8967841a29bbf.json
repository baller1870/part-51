It begins with a string quartet piece that sounds like something out of the new Battlestar Galactica before moving into more traditional acoustic guitar, folk style music, akin to the soft sound of Sufjan Stevens. From there, the CD becomes more dense and moves into the realms of post-rock acts like Radiohead, Sigur Ros, Mogwai and Godspeed. Finally, the strange final movement is a smooth, ambient soundscape that lands somewhere between an experiment by Eno and a haunting melody sung by the late Jeff Buckley. \n\nAll five tracks have been ripped from the CD at 192kbps for decent sound in a fast download. I haven\\\\\\&amp;#039;t scanned in any of the pages from the giant graphic novel that comes with the CD. Maybe I\\\\\\&amp;#039;ll make it a seperate upload in the comics category, if there are any requests. In the meantime, the comics are being posted at http://www.transmission-x.com. \n\nRAGNI E.P. \n\n1 - Minden \n2 - The Somnambulist \n3 - Rather Be You \n4 - The North Sea Epoch \n5 - Ko?ysanka \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cc1f6cd506a2a0035e59f945de8967841a29bbf","amp;dn":"Ragni+E.P.+%282007+-+192kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cc1f6cd506a2a0035e59f945de8967841a29bbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,193,246,205,80,106,42,0,53,229,159,148,93,232,150,120,65,162,155,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
